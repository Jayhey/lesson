We also calculated the systemic inflammation \\nusing the periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) to evaluate its correlation\\nwith NGAL in the study groups.\\nMETHODOLOGY: Eighty systemically healthy and non-smoking individuals were\\nseparated into four groups of 20: clinically healthy (Group 1), gingivitis (Group\\n2), stage I generalized periodontitis (Group 3, Grade A), and stage III\\ngeneralized periodontitis (Group 4, Grade A). Sociodemographic characteristics\\nand periodontal parameters were recorded, and PISA was calculated. The serum and \\nsalivary levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10, and NGAL were determined using the\\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\\nRESULTS: We observed a significant increase in serum and salivary NGAL levels\\nfrom healthy to periodontitis groups (p=0.000). Group 2 presented significantly\\nhigher serum and salivary IL-10 levels and salivary IL-1β levels than Group 3\\n(p=0.000). Serum and salivary parameters (IL-1β, IL-10, and NGAL levels) were\\nstrongly positively correlated to periodontal parameters and PISA values\\n(p=0.000). Groups 2 and 3 showed overlapping PISA values.\\nCONCLUSION: The overlapping PISA values found in Groups 2 and 3 suggest that\\ngingivitis might progress to a systemic inflammatory burden somewhat comparable\\nto stage I periodontitis. This finding is supported by the higher serum and\\nsalivary cytokines/mediators levels in the gingivitis group than in stage I\\nperiodontitis group. Serum and salivary NGAL levels increased proportionally to\\ndisease severity and PISA.

Secondary variables included\\nprobing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BoP), gingival margin level,\\ndentin hypersensitivity, and percent of pockets converted to sites no longer\\nrequiring surgical treatment.\\nRESULTS: CAL changed significantly (P \\xa0<\\xa00.001) from baseline to 12 months for\\nboth treatment modalities (test\\xa0=\\xa0-2.2 ± 1.5\\xa0mm versus control\\xa0=\\xa0-2.1 ± 1.3\\xa0mm)\\nand similarly for PPD; the difference between groups was not significant. A\\nsignificant difference, favoring test conditions, was observed in percentage of\\nboth healthy PPDs (pockets\\xa0<\\xa05\\xa0mm) and converted pockets (sites no longer\\nrequiring surgical treatment); 79.8% of test versus 65.9% of control sites.

Initial studies identified CRISPRs as central elements used\\nby bacteria to protect against foreign nucleic acids; however, emerging evidence \\npoints to CRISPR involvement in bacterial virulence. The present study aimed to\\nidentify the participation of one CRISPR-Cas protein, Cas3, in the virulence of\\nthe oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, an organism highly associated with\\nperiodontitis. Our results show that compared to the wild type, a mutant with a\\ndeletion of the Cas3 gene, an essential nuclease part of the class 1 type I\\nCRISPR-Cas system, increased the virulence of P. gingivalis In vitro infection\\nmodeling revealed only mildly enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines by\\nTHP-1 cells when infected with the mutant strain. Dual transcriptome sequencing\\n(RNA-seq) analysis of infected THP-1 cells showed an increase in expression of\\ngenes associated with pathogenesis in response to Δcas3 mutant infection, with\\nthe target of Cas3 activities in neutrophil chemotaxis and gene silencing. The\\nimportance of cas3 in controlling virulence was corroborated in a Galleria\\nmellonella infection model, where the presence of the Δcas3 mutant resulted in a \\nstatistically significant increase in mortality of G. mellonella A time-series\\nanalysis of transcription patterning during infection showed that G. mellonella\\nelicited very different immune responses to the wild-type and the Δcas3 mutant\\nstrains and revealed a rearrangement of association in coexpression networks.\\nTogether, these observations show for the first time that Cas3 plays a\\nsignificant role in regulating the virulence of P. gingivalis IMPORTANCE\\nPorphyromonas gingivalis is a key pathogen of periodontitis, a polymicrobial\\ndisease characterized by a chronic inflammation that destroys the tissues\\nsupporting the teeth. Thus, understanding the virulence potential of P.\\ngingivalis is essential to maintaining a healthy oral microbiome. In nonoral\\norganisms, CRISPR-Cas systems have been shown to modulate a variety of microbial \\nprocesses, including protection from exogenous nucleic acids, and, more recently,\\nhave been implicated in bacterial virulence. Previously, our clinical findings\\nidentified activation of the CRISPR-Cas system in patient samples at the\\ntransition to disease; however, the mechanism of contribution to disease remained\\nunknown. The importance of the present study resides in that it is becoming\\nincreasingly clear that CRISPR-associated proteins have broader functions than\\ninitially thought and that those functions now include their role in the\\nvirulence of periodontal pathogens.

       "  'The most fundamental function of an epithelial tissue is to act as a barrier,\\nregulating interactions between the external environment and the body. This\\nbarrier function typically requires a contiguous cell layer but since teeth\\npenetrate the oral epithelium, a modified barrier has evolved, called the\\njunctional epithelium (JE). In health, the JE attaches to the tooth, sealing the \\ninside of the body against oral micro-organisms. Breakdown of the JE barrier\\nresults in periodontal ligament (PDL) disintegration, alveolar bone resorption,\\nand ultimately tooth loss. Using lineage tracing and DNA pulse-chase analyses, we\\nidentified an anatomical location in the JE that supported both fast- and\\nslow-cycling Wnt-responsive stem cells that contributed to self-renewal of the\\ntissue. Stem cells produced daughter cells with an extraordinarily high rate of\\nturnover that maintained JE integrity for 1.4 y in mice. Blocking cell\\nproliferation via a chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) eliminated\\nfast-cycling stem cells, which caused JE degeneration, PDL destruction, and bone \\nresorption. Upon removal of 5-Fu, slow-cycling stem cells regenerated both the\\nstructure and barrier function of the JE.

RA and\\nperiodontitis have similarities in inflammatory mechanism, morphology, and\\nhistopathology. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic, multifactorial degenerative\\ndisease characterized by the deterioration of cartilage in joints.\\nObjective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and severity of\\nperiodontal disease in patients with established RA and OA.\\nMaterials and Methods: A total of 200 patients reporting to the Department of\\nOrthopaedics, KIMSDU, Karad were included in the study. Patients were divided\\ninto two groups: Group 1 that included 100 patients with established RA diagnosed\\naccording to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification 1987 criteria \\nand Group 2 that comprised 100 patients diagnosed with OA. Demographic profile,\\nmedical and dental history, oral hygiene practices, and smoking status of study\\nparticipants were recorded. Periodontal status of the patients were evaluated\\nusing the simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S), Loe and Silness gingival index\\n(GI), probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). On the\\nbasis of the CAL score periodontitis severity was defined as slight, moderate,\\nand severe. Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were considered\\nas a serological marker in RA. Serological tests were performed to measure RF and\\nCRP. Periodontal parameters and serological tests were correlated.\\nResults: This study reported 45% severe periodontitis prevalence in RA compared\\nto OA group, which was 33%. Severity of periodontitis is significantly greater in\\nRF positive RA group with mean CAL 5.38 mm compared to RF negative RA group with \\nmean CAL 2.81 mm (P = 0.001). There was moderate positive correlation found\\nbetween RF titer and severity of periodontitis (r = 0.311).\\nConclusion: The severity of periodontitis was significantly higher among the\\npatients with established RA as compared to patients with OA. RF positive\\npatients had higher periodontal disease compared to RF negative patients. There\\nwas an increase in the mean clinical attachment loss with increase in RF titer.'],\n",

The aim of the present cross-sectional validation study was,\\ntherefore, to evaluate the levels of agreement between remote diagnoses derived\\nfrom IOS and diagnoses based on clinical examinations for assessing dental and\\nperiodontal conditions.\\nMETHODS: The test sample comprised 10 patients representing different clinical\\nconditions. Following the acquisition of IOS (Trios, 3Shape), a full-mouth dental\\nand periodontal examination was done and periapical radiographs were taken. Ten\\ndentists were asked to perform dental and periodontal scorings for each of the\\nten patients on a tablet computer presenting the IOS. Scores included diagnosis\\nof gingivitis/periodontitis, and evaluated presence as well as amount of plaque\\nand calculus, and presence of teeth exhibiting gingival recession, furcation\\ninvolvement, erosion, tooth wear, stain, and non-carious cervical lesion, as well\\nas presence of decayed, filled, and crowned teeth and implants. In a second round\\nof assessments, the periapical radiographs were provided and the dentists were\\nable to change the scores. The time for the remote assessment was recorded. The\\nagreement between remote and clinical scorings (reference) was then analyzed\\ndescriptively.\\nRESULTS: The mean time for the tele assessment was 3.17\\u2009min and the additional\\nconsultation of the radiographs accounted for another 1.48\\u2009min. The sensitivity\\nand specificity values were 0.61 and 0.39 for gingivitis and 0.67 and 0.33 for\\nperiodontitis, with no relevant changes when radiographs were provided for the\\ndiagnosis of periodontitis (0.72 and 0.28). The agreement for dichotomized dental\\nand periodontal indices ranged between 78 and 95%. With the provision of\\nradiographs, the remote examiners were able to detect existing filled teeth,\\ncrowned teeth, and implants, whereas the detection of decayed teeth (70%) was not\\nimproved.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The remote examination using IOS was effective in detecting dental\\nfindings, whereas periodontal conditions could not be assessed with the same\\naccuracy. Still, remote assessment of IOS would allow a time-efficient screening \\nand triage of patients. Improvement of the image quality of IOS may further allow\\nto increase the accuracy of remote assessments in dentistry.

Zoledronate\\n(ZLD) is an antiresorptive drug used to control osteoporosis but can lead to\\nosteonecrosis of the jaw. RESV, a natural product, can reduce bone loss and\\ncontrol and prevent osteoporosis. Thus, this study aimed at investigating the\\neffect of RESV on the progression of EP in estrogen-deficient rats.\\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: The animals were subjected to the OVT or sham surgery to\\ninduce estrogen-deficiency and then were divided into the groups: OVT\\xa0+\\xa0RESV (n: \\n10); OVT\\xa0+\\xa0PLAC (n: 10): OVT\\xa0+\\xa0placebo; OVT\\xa0+\\xa0ZLD +PLA (n: 10); OVT\\xa0+\\xa0RESV +ZLD\\n(n: 10): OVT\\xa0+\\xa0RESV and ZLD; SHAM (n: 10): non-ovariectomized animals\\xa0+\\xa0placebo. \\nTo induce estrogen deficiency, the rats were subjected to ovariectomy.\\nExperimental periodontitis was induced by the placement of a ligature at the\\nsecond maxillary molars. Daily administration of the placebo solution,\\nresveratrol (10\\xa0mg/kg), and ZLD (0.1\\xa0mg/kg) was carried out for a period 42\\xa0days \\nprior to initiation of EP, and then for another 28\\xa0days following ligature\\nplacement. After euthanasia, the specimens were processed for micro-CT and\\nmorphometric analysis of bone loss (linear measurement), and the gingival tissue \\nsurrounding the maxillary second molar was collected for the quantification of\\ninflammatory markers using Luminex/MAGPix, of oxidative stress markers using\\nELISA assay, and gene expression analysis of bone markers, by real-time PCR.\\nRESULTS: Morphometric and micro-CT analysis showed higher bone loss and lower\\nbone density, respectively, in OVT\\xa0+\\xa0PLAC when compared to the other groups\\n(P\\xa0<\\xa0.05). ZLD treated groups had lower alveolar bone loss, as well as, higher\\ndensity and percentage of bone volume, when compared to OVT\\xa0+\\xa0RESV and\\nSHAM\\xa0+\\xa0PLAC groups (P\\xa0<\\xa0.05). IL-4 levels were significantly lower in the\\nOVT\\xa0+\\xa0PLAC group versus OVT\\xa0+\\xa0ZLD +RESV and SHAM\\xa0+\\xa0PLAC (P\\xa0<\\xa0.05).

Porphyromonas gingivalis is an oral pathogen\\nassociated with the development of periodontitis. Escape from macrophage\\nphagocytosis was tested by infecting THP-1-derived human macrophages and RAW\\n264.7 mouse macrophages with strains of P. gingivalis W83 and 33277 as well as\\nStreptococcus gordonii DL1 and Escherichia coli OP50 at MOI = 100. CFU counts for\\nall intracellular bacteria were determined. Then, infected macrophages were\\ncultured in media without antibiotics to allow for escape and escaping bacteria\\nwere quantified by CFU counting. P. gingivalis W83 displayed over 60% of the\\nbacterial escape from the total amount of intracellular CFUs, significantly\\nhigher compared to all other bacteria strains. In addition, bacterial escape and \\nre-entry were also tested and P. gingivalis W83, once again, showed the highest\\nnumbers of CFUs able to exit and re-enter macrophages. Lastly, the function of\\nthe PG0717 gene of P. gingivalis W83 was tested on escape but found not related\\nto this activity. Altogether, our results suggest that P. gingivalis W83 is able \\nto significantly avoid macrophage phagocytosis. We propose this ability is likely\\nlinked to the chronic nature of periodontitis.'],\n",

The data were statistically analysed using t test, one-way ANOVA,\\npost hoc test and paired t test (P = 0.05).\\nRESULTS: Of the teeth, 94.6% were clinically successful based on the lack or\\nregression of signs and symptoms after 48 months follow-up. REP resulted in a\\nstatistically significant increase in root length, decrease in pulp space\\ndiameter and periradicular radiolucency (P < 0.05). CBCT images illustrated\\nvarious patterns of root maturation including an increased thickening of the\\ncanal walls and continued root maturation (37.1%), continued root development\\nwith the apical foramen remaining open (57.1%), severe calcification\\n(obliteration) of the canal space (2.9%) and hard tissue barrier formation in the\\ncanal space between the coronal plug and the root apex (2.9%).\\nCONCLUSION: This study highlighted that the expected outcome of radiographic root\\ndevelopment was less predictable when immature permanent teeth with periradicular\\npathosis were treated with REP.\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE: The size and extent (expansion/destruction of the cortical\\nplate) of periradicular lesions and abscesses influence the outcome of REP.

The\\nhemimandibles were removed and submitted to radiographic analysis,\\nmicrocomputerized microtomography (μCT) and histomorphometric analysis.\\nRESULTS: Radiographic analysis revealed that pro- and paraprobiotics enhanced the\\npercentage of mesial bone support. The μCT analysis showed that paraprobiotic\\ntreatment increased bone volume and trabecular number while decreasing total bone\\nporosity and trabecular separation.

All cases were re-evaluated within a 3-month period until radiographic\\nhealing was observed. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed\\nannually. Pre- and postoperative periapical radiographs were evaluated using the \\nPAI system.\\nRESULTS: Of the 242 cases, 219 participants completed their treatment with annual\\nfollow-up.

       "  'The pulp-dentin complex is innervated by a high density of trigeminal neurons\\nfree nerve endings. These neuronal fibers are highly specialized to sense noxious\\nstimuli such as thermal, mechanical, chemical, and biological cues. This robust\\nalert system provides immediate feedback of potential or actual injury triggering\\nreflex responses that protect the teeth from further injury. In the case of\\npatients, pain is the most important experience that leads them to seek oral\\nhealth care. The adequate removal of the etiology, such as caries, provides ample\\nopportunity for the robust reparative and regenerative potential of the\\npulp-dentin complex to restore homeostasis. In addition to this elaborated\\nsurveillance system, evidence has accumulated that sensory neuronal fibers can\\npotentially modulate various steps of the reparative and regenerative process\\nthrough cellular communication processes. These include modulation of\\nimmunologic, angiogenic, and mineralization responses. Despite these orchestrated\\ncellular events, the defense of the pulp-dentin complex may be overwhelmed,\\nresulting in pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis. Regenerative endodontic\\nprocedures have evolved to restore the once lost function of the pulp-dentin\\ncomplex. After these procedures, a large subset of successful cases demonstrates \\na positive response to sensitivity testing, suggesting reinnervation of the canal\\nspace. This process is likely mediated through cellular and noncellular release\\nof neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived nerve growth factor. In addition,\\nthese newly recruited nerve fibers appear equipped to sense thermal stimuli\\nthrough nonhydrodynamic mechanisms. Collectively, the significance of innervation\\nin the normal physiology of the pulp-dentin complex and its role in regeneration \\nneed to be better appreciated to promote further research in this area that could\\npotentially bring new therapeutic opportunities.'],\n",

The effects of the following potential explanatory\\nvariables on these parameters were analyzed: the presence of keratinized mucosa, \\nage, sex, oral hygiene status, history of periodontitis, cigarette smoking,\\nimplant site, and time elapsed since prosthesis delivery. Statistical analysis\\nincluded multivariate ordinal logistic regression and generalized estimating\\nequations. Significance wa s established when two-sided p-values were less than\\n0.05.\\nRESULTS: The mPI, mBI, and PPD in the presence or absence of keratinized mucosa\\ndid not show statistically significant differences. However, the presence of\\nkeratinized mucosa was significantly related to BL (odds ratio 4.33, p < 0.01).\\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that the presence of keratinized\\nmucosa is useful for reducing bone resorption and can help to maintain\\nperi-implant tissue health.'],\n",

The formulations were characterized \\nin vitro and finally tested in dogs with naturally occurring periodontitis, which\\nwere not euthanized afterward. Results showed that PIC/DOX/LXA4 hydrogel could be\\neasily prepared and injected into periodontal pockets. The PIC hydrogel\\nfacilitated the release of DOX or LXA4 for around 4 days in vitro. When applied\\nin dogs, the hydrogel exerted no local or systemic adverse effects. Gels loaded\\nwith LXA4 and/or DOX reduced the subgingival bacterial load and pro-inflammatory \\ninterleukin-8 level.

       "  'BACKGROUND: Various types of oral tumors, either benign or malignant, are\\ncommonly found in dogs. Since saliva directly contacts the tumors and saliva\\ncollection is non-invasive, easily accessible and cost effective, salivary\\nbiomarkers are practical to be used for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of these\\ndiseases. However, there is limited knowledge of protein expression in saliva for\\ncanine oral tumors. The present study aimed to investigate novel biomarkers from \\nthe salivary proteome of dogs with early- and late-stage oral melanoma (EOM and\\nLOM, respectively), oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), benign oral tumors (BN),\\nand periodontitis and healthy controls (CP), using an in-gel digestion coupled\\nwith mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS). The relationships between protein candidates\\nand chemotherapy drugs were explored and the expression of potential biomarkers\\nin saliva and tissues was verified by western blot analysis.\\nRESULTS: For saliva samples, increased expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase\\nnon-receptor type 5 (PTPN5) was shown in all tumor groups compared with the CP\\ngroup. Marked expression of PTPN5 was also observed in LOM and OSCC compared with\\nthat in BN and EOM. In addition, tumor protein p53 (p53), which appeared in the\\nPTPN5-drug interactions, was exhibited to be expressed in all tumor groups\\ncompared with that in the CP group. For tissue samples, increased expression of\\np53 was shown in LOM compared with the control group.\\nCONCLUSION: PTPN5 and p53 were proposed to be potential salivary biomarkers of\\ncanine oral tumors.'],\n",

The effect of UTE treatment for 11 days on\\nthe ligature-induced bone loss was assessed focusing on several aspects:\\nmacroscopic and histological analysis of bone loss, neutrophil and osteoclast\\ninfiltration, and anabolic effect. The effect of UTE on bone marrow cell\\ndifferentiation to osteoclasts was assessed in vitro.\\nRESULTS: The analysis of UTE by UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS identified 24 compounds,\\namong pentacyclic or tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids and phenols. The\\nadministration of UTE for 11 days on ligature-induced rat attenuated the\\nperiodontal attachment loss and alveolar bone resorption. It also diminished\\nneutrophil migration to the gingiva tissue, demonstrated by a lower level of MPO.\\nUTE treatment also decreased the level of RANKL/OPG ratio, the main osteoclast\\ndifferentiation-related genes, followed by reduced TRAP-positive cell number\\nlining the alveolar bone. Additionally, the level of bone-specific alkaline\\nphosphatase, an anabolic bone marker, was elevated in the plasma of UTE treated\\nrats. Next, we determined a possible direct effect of UTE on osteoclast\\ndifferentiation in vitro. The incubation of primary osteoclast with UTE decreased\\nRANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation without affecting cell viability. This\\neffect was supported by downregulation of the nuclear factor activated T-cells,\\ncytoplasmic 1 expression, a master regulator of osteoclast differentiation, and\\nother osteoclast-specific activity markers, such as cathepsin K and TRAP.\\nCONCLUSION: UTE exhibited an effective anti-resorptive and anabolic effects,\\nwhich highlight it as a potential natural product for the treatment of certain\\nosteolytic diseases, such as periodontitis.'],\n",

The average ICC was 0.68\\nwith a 95% confidence interval of 0.53-0.77 (p <\\u2009.001) indicating moderate to\\ngood reliability. Comparing the types of teeth, the central incisors,\\nparticularly the lower central incisors showed the highest ICC values (ICC:\\n0.822, CI: 0.77-0.86) indicating good reliability while the premolar and molars\\nshowed poor to moderate agreement (Maxillary premolars ICC: 0.464, CI:\\n-0.18-0.74; maxillary first molar ICC: 0.516, CI: -0.154-0.772; mandibular first \\npremolar ICC: 0.662, CI: 0.269-0.782; mandibular first molar ICC: 0.625, CI:\\n0.31-0.82).

We used a random-effects \\nmodel for meta-analysis.\\nRESULTS: Eight studies involving 810 patients were included. The overall risk of \\nbias was moderate. Seven of 8 studies used a visual analog scale to measure pain \\nintensity. Compared with controls, intracanal cryotherapy significantly reduced\\npostoperative pain at 6 (mean difference = -1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI],\\n-0.61 to -2.14; P < .05; I2 = 76%; moderate-quality evidence) and 24 hours after \\nthe procedure (mean difference = -1.43; 95% confidence interval, -0.70 to -2.15; \\nP < .05; I2 = 89%; moderate-quality evidence).

       "  'Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can destroy periodontal\\ntissue. Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is widely applied to treat\\nperiodontitis. However, the challenge is to develop a GTR membrane capable of\\nsimultaneously regenerating periodontal tissue and preventing epithelial\\ndowngrowth into the defect. Herein, blended hydrogels composed of polyvinyl\\nalcohol (PVA) and fish collagen (Col) were prepared as GTR membranes. The\\nmorphology, Col release, and cellular behavior of the blended hydrogels were\\nevaluated. The results showed that the surface porosity and Col release of the\\nPVA/Col blended hydrogels were enhanced by increasing the Col concentration. The \\nadhesion and proliferation of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPDLFs) and\\nhuman gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) on the PVA/Col blended hydrogels can be\\nregulated by tuning the PVA/Col ratio. The PVA/Col (50:50) blended hydrogel\\nexhibited the highest cell proliferation rate for HPDLFs with spread cell\\nmorphology; the lowest viability for HGFs was found on the PVA/Col (100:0)\\nhydrogel.

Participants were followed up\\nuntil either the occurrence of mortality, or the end of the study on December 31,\\n2018. Cox proportional hazards regression and competing risk hazard models were\\nused to examine the association between periodontitis and oral cancer mortality.\\nResults: Periodontitis and loss of teeth were significantly associated with oral \\ncancer mortality. Compared to oral cancer mortality in healthy subjects, the HR\\nand 95% CI in patients with mild, moderate, and severe periodontitis were 4.46\\n(0.94-21.06), 5.16 (1.14-23.39), and 6.65 (1.51-29.36), respectively. The HR (95%\\nCI) was 1.05 (1.01-1.09) for tooth loss after controlling for potential\\nconfounding factors. All the increases in risk persisted in patients aged ≥80\\nyears.\\nConclusion: The present study provides substantial evidence that poor periodontal\\nhealth is associated with oral cancer mortality. It is necessary to underline the\\nimportance of considering periodontitis in the prevention of oral cancer,\\nparticularly in the older patients.'],\n",

       "  'Background: Oral commensals contribute to microbe-host symbiosis in periodontal\\nhomeostasis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) as the keystone\\npathogen critically accounts for the shift of symbiosis to dysbiosis and\\nperiodontal destruction. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like\\nreceptor (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated\\ninterleukin-1β (IL-1β) is significantly involved in periodontal diseases, and\\nnotably P. gingivalis enables to modulate the induction and expression of NLRP3. \\nWhereas, the exact mechanism by which NLRP3 inflammasome is regulated in response\\nto commensal and pathogenic bacteria remains unclear. Methods: To examine the\\nexpression of IL-1β and NLRPs inflammasome in tissues with severe chronic\\nperiodontitis, and further investigate how Caspase-4-dependent non-canonical\\nNLRP3 inflammasome pathways functioned during the interactions of Streptococcus\\nmitis (S. mitis) and P. gingivalis with human THP-1 cells. Results: IL-1β and\\nNLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP12, and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasomes are highly\\nexpressed in gingival tissues with severe chronic periodontitis. In human THP-1\\ncells, P. gingivalis activates the synthesis and secretion of IL-1β to higher\\nlevels than S. mitis. Importantly, NLRP3-, Caspase-1-, and Caspase-4-siRNA\\nknockdown THP-1 cells treated with P. gingivalis exhibited a lower expression\\nlevel of IL-1β as compared to the control cells. In addition, silencing of either\\nCASP4 or CASP1 can lead to a concurrent or reciprocal decrease in the expression \\nof the other. Of note, the IL-1β induction is not affected in the S.\\nmitis-treated THP-1 cells with the silence of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and Caspase-4\\ngenes. Conclusion: NLRP3/Caspase-4 and NLRP3/Caspase-1 dependent IL-1β production\\nmay crucially contribute to the dysregulated immuno-inflammatory response in\\nperiodontal pathogenesis.'],\n",

Results: A total of 79 evaluable questionnaires from\\n66 female (83.5%) and 13 male (16.5%) participants were analyzed. On average,\\nafter the first condition, it takes 18.36 years before EDS are correctly\\ndiagnosed. Oral conditions were described by 69.6% of the participants.

The present cross-sectional study\\nevaluated the association between different types and quantity of alcoholic\\nbeverage consumption (alone and interacting with smoking) and the probability to \\nsuffer from severe periodontitis in the French e-cohort NutriNet-Santé.\\nMETHODS: The study population consisted of 35,390 adults (mean age: 49.04 ± 13.94\\nyears), who filled oral health questionnaires and completed at least three\\nnon-consecutive 24-hour dietary records. Data on type and frequency of alcoholic \\nbeverage consumption were obtained from a semi-quantitative self-reported alcohol\\nfrequency questionnaire; the daily quantity (g/day) was estimated from the\\n24-hour dietary records. The probability of severe periodontitis (main dependent \\nvariable) was assessed by calculating the modified periodontal screening score\\n(mPESS) from selected questions.\\nRESULTS: A total of 7263 individuals (20.5%) presented a high probability of\\nsuffering from severe periodontitis (high-mPESS). After adjusting for confounding\\nfactors, the frequency of alcoholic beverage consumption was significantly higher\\namong high-mPESS group than their low-mPESS counterparts, especially for hard\\nliquor/spirits (1.9 ± 1.4 days/week for high-PESS versus 1.6 ± 1.1 days/week the \\nlow-PESS [P\\xa0<\\xa00.0001]).

Unstable periodontitis and\\ngingivitis were consistently associated with increased risk of high/uncontrolled \\nBP (OR\\u200a=\\u200a1.65, 95% CI\\u200a=\\u200a2.14-1.82; OR\\u200a=\\u200a1.49, 95% CI\\u200a=\\u200a1.22-1.82, respectively). \\nInflammatory markers allowed a maximum of 12% gain in the models' predictive\\npower.\\nCONCLUSION: Gingival bleeding contributes to shaping the relationship between\\nperiodontal diseases and BP, but the burden represented by periodontitis is also \\ncrucial.

This review examines the relationship between skin\\nconditions and various oral health metrics to better understand how oral\\ndiseases, especially periodontitis, might influence the development or prognosis \\nof several conditions, including aphthous stomatitis, atopic dermatitis, lichen\\nplanus, pemphigus, pemphigoid, and psoriasis. METHODS: Using the PubMed search\\nengine between Summer 2017 and Summer 2018, searches were performed for: oral\\nhealth OR oral hygiene AND psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis, hidradenitis\\nsuppurativa, acne inversa, pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet's syndrome, neutrophilic\\ndermatosis, subcorneal pustular dermatosis, hives, urticaria, cutaneous lupus,\\npemphigoid, pemphigus, or lichen planus OR aphthous stomatitis. The abstract of\\narticles written in English were reviewed by the investigators and selected for\\ninclusion if the study involved a correlation between oral health/hygiene and\\nskin disease. After studies were included, the references were reviewed for\\nadditional relevant studies. Diseases listed in the search terms that were not\\nultimately discussed in this review did not produce any articles of relevance.\\nRESULTS: Aphthous stomatitis is correlated with poor periodontal health and\\ngreater plaque accumulation. Atopic dermatitis shows an association with\\ngingivitis, toothaches, and oral infections. Heavier enamel plaque burden and\\nreduced oral care are implicated in the exacerbation of lichen planus. Mucous\\nmembrane pemphigoid and pemphigus are intimately influenced by oral health,\\nunderscoring the important role of good oral health and hygiene. Psoriasis\\npresents a strong connection with oral streptococcal bacterial burden, has been\\nshown to be improved or even cured with tonsillectomy, and has treatment outcomes\\nthat are generally associated with periodontal disease. CONCLUSION: Comorbid\\ndisease associations are frequently being reported in dermatology, spurring\\ncollaboration between multiple specialists and dermatologists. This review\\nemphasizes a need for closer collaboration between dermatologists and dentists to\\ntreat several common skin diseases.\"],\n",

Patients who had undergone at least 1\\xa0year of\\nfollow-up after root canal treatment were recalled, and their genomic DNA was\\nextracted from saliva. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DEFB1 at the\\ng. -52G>A (rs1799946) and g. -20G>A (rs11362) positions were analysed using\\nreal-time polymerase chain reaction. The chi-squared test was performed, and the \\nodds ratios were calculated using Epi Info 3.5.2. Logistic regression analysis in\\nthe codominant model, using the time of follow-up as a variable, was used to\\nevaluate the SNP-SNP interaction. All tests were performed with an established\\nalpha of 0.05 (P\\xa0=\\xa00.05).\\nRESULTS: For the rs11362 polymorphism in the codominant and recessive models,\\npatients who carried two copies of the T allele had a significantly lower risk of\\ndeveloping PAP (P\\xa0=\\xa00.040 and P\\xa0=\\xa00.031, respectively).

Data were statistically analyzed at \\na 5% significance level.\\nRESULTS: Descriptive statistical analysis showed that among 395 first molars, 218\\nhad at least one missed canal, and 186 (46.5%) had a missed canal and periapical \\nlesion simultaneously.

The three studies that investigated, at \\nthe proposed conditions of use, modified GI (and not BoP or GI) in subjects with \\ngingivitis, but without periodontitis, or were conducted in patients with\\nperiodontitis support an effect of lozenges with L. reuteri on gum function. Some\\nevidence has been provided for mechanisms by which consumption of lozenges\\ncontaining L. reuteri could improve outcomes of gingivitis in patients with\\nchronic periodontitis but the relevance of such mechanisms for the target\\npopulation of the claim (i.e. subjects without periodontitis) is unclear. The\\nPanel\\xa0concludes that the evidence provided is insufficient to establish a cause\\nand effect relationship between the consumption of orodispersible lozenges\\ncontaining a combination of L. reuteri DSM 17938 and L. reuteri ATCC PTA 5289 and\\nmaintenance of normal gum function.',\n",

Therefore, research papers \\nshowed that dentists can easily miss the root canals in diagnosis and\\ninflammatory diffusion; which could cause unsuccessful root canal treatment\\nleading to various possible infections and no change in original inflammations.\\nIn this report, the diagnose and clinical management of an unusual case of a\\nmaxillary center incisor with three independent roots and three root canals is\\npresented, along with a demonstration of using CBCT (Cone Beam Computed\\nTomography) and collaborate with other departments to successfully accomplish an \\naccurate diagnosis of the morphology and quantity of the root canal system.\\nPATIENT CONCERNS: The patient was referred to clinic for his repeatedly abscessed\\nin the gums of the left upper central incisor.\\nDIAGNOSES: Based on clinical and radiographic evidences, the patient was\\ntentatively diagnosed with a chronic periapical periodontitis for #21 tooth.\\nINTERVENTIONS: The patient was performed with the conventional root canal\\ntreatment and then clinical observed.\\nOUTCOMES: At the second visit after 7 days, the patient was not sensitive to\\npercussion.

       "  \"Periodontal and periapical lesions are infectious inflammatory osteolitytic\\nconditions in which a complex inflammatory immune response mediates bone\\ndestruction. However, the uncertainty of a lesion's progressive or stable\\nphenotype complicates understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms\\ntriggering lesion activity. Evidence from clinical and preclinical studies of\\nboth periodontal and periapical lesions points to a high\\u2009receptor activator of\\nNF-κB ligand/osteoprotegerin (RANKL/OPG) ratio as the primary determinant of\\nosteolytic activity, while a low RANKL/OPG ratio is often observed in inactive\\nlesions. Proinflammatory cytokines directly modulate RANKL/OPG expression and\\nconsequently drive lesion progression, along with pro-osteoclastogenic support\\nprovided by Th1, Th17, and B cells. Conversely, the cooperative action between\\nTh2 and Tregs subsets creates an anti-inflammatory and proreparative milieu\\nassociated with lesion stability. Interestingly, the trigger for lesion status\\nswitch from active to inactive can originate from an unanticipated RANKL\\nimmunoregulatory feedback, involving the induction of Tregs and a host response\\noutcome with immunological tolerance features. In this context, dendritic cells\\n(DCs) appear as potential determinants of host response switch, since RANKL\\nimprint a tolerogenic phenotype in DCs, described to be involved in both Tregs\\nand immunological tolerance generation. The tolerance state systemically and\\nlocally suppresses the development of exacerbated and pathogenic responses and\\ncontributes to lesions stability. However, immunological tolerance break by\\ncomorbidities or dysbiosis could explain lesions relapse toward activity.\\nTherefore, this article will provide a critical review of the current knowledge\\nconcerning periodontal and periapical lesions activity and the underlying\\nmolecular mechanisms associated with the host response. Further studies are\\nrequired to unravel the role of immunological responsiveness or tolerance in the \\ndetermination of lesion status, as well as the potential cooperative and/or\\ninhibitory interplay among effector cells and their impact on RANKL/OPG balance\\nand lesion outcome.\"],\n",

Total bacteria count in group C\\u2009+\\u2009L was significantly\\nlower compared to group C only at 12 weeks and 6 months of follow-up.\\nFurthermore, there was high significant decrease in the number of Aggregatibacter\\nactinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and\\nPrevotella intermedia at all the follow-up periods. Conclusions: As adjunctive to\\nSRP, diode laser-assisted nonsurgical therapy of periodontitis has significantly \\nimproved clinical parameters of PI and POB and has significantly reduced the\\nclinical attachment loss (CAL) and PD compared to the control group after 1 year \\nof follow-up. A significant reduction in periodontal pathogens has been observed \\nin group C\\u2009+\\u2009L only at 12 weeks and 6 months of follow-up.'],\n",

Apical and marginal periodontitis were\\ndiagnosed during clinical and radiographic oral examinations, and CAC on\\npanoramic radiographs (n\\xa0=\\xa0492). Presence and severity of CAD were registered\\nfrom angiography. Subgingival dysbiotic bacterial species were quantitated using \\ncheckerboard DNA-DNA-hybridization, and serum and saliva antibody levels were\\ndetermined by immunoassays. The cohort was followed-up for 10\\xa0years or until\\ndeath (median 9.9, range 0.21-10.4) via linkage to the national death register.\\nThe statistical models were adjusted for age, gender, smoking, hypertension,\\ndiabetes and dyslipidemia.\\nRESULTS: A total of 102 (20.7%) patients had detectable CAC, which was moderate\\nin 81 (16.4%) and severe in 21 (4.3%). CAC was associated (OR, 95% CI) with\\nsevere apical periodontitis (2.25, 1.15-4.41), root canal fillings (1.15,\\n1.04-1.26), alveolar bone loss (2.66, 1.21-5.84), severe periodontal inflammation\\n(2.23, 1.11-4.47), high level of gram-negative subgingival species (2.73,\\n1.34-5.50), saliva IgG against dysbiotic species (1.05, 1.01-1.10/unit) and\\nsevere (2.58, 1.36-4.90) and chronic (2.13, 1.15-3.93) CAD. A total of 105\\n(20.7%) patients died during the follow-up and 53 (10.4%) deaths were because of \\ncardiovascular diseases (CVD). Severe CAC predicted worse survival with HRs (95% \\nCI) of 3.08 (1.58-6.06) for all-cause and 3.43 (1.42-8.25) for CVD death.\\nCONCLUSIONS: CAC on panoramic tomography was associated with (i) apical and\\nmarginal periodontitis and dysbiotic bacterial species giving rise to an\\nimmunological response, and with (ii) severe, chronic CAD and increased\\nmortality.

       "  'Periodontitis is a widespread oral disease that results in the loss of alveolar\\nbone. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), which is a new therapeutic option,\\npromotes alveolar bone regeneration in periodontal bone injury models. This study\\ninvestigated the protective effect of LIPUS on oxidative stress in periodontitis \\nand the mechanism underlying this process. Methods: An experimental periodontitis\\nmodel was induced by administering a ligature. Immunohistochemistry was performed\\nto detect the expression levels of oxidative stress, osteogenic, and\\nosteoclastogenic markers in vivo. Cell viability and osteogenic differentiation\\nwere analyzed using the Cell Counting Kit-8, alkaline phosphatase, and Alizarin\\nRed staining assays. A reactive oxygen species assay kit, lipid peroxidation MDA \\nassay kit, and western blotting were used to determine oxidative stress status in\\nvitro. To verify the role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), \\nan oxidative regulator, during LIPUS treatment, the siRNA technique and Nrf2-/-\\nmice were used. The PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 was utilized to identify the\\neffects of the PI3K-Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Results: Alveolar bone\\nresorption, which was experimentally induced by periodontitis in vivo, was\\nalleviated by LIPUS via activation of Nrf2. Oxidative stress, induced via H2O2\\ntreatment in vitro, inhibited cell viability and suppressed osteogenic\\ndifferentiation. These effects were also alleviated by LIPUS treatment via Nrf2\\nactivation. Nrf2 silencing blocked the antioxidant effect of LIPUS by diminishing\\nheme oxygenase-1 expression. Nrf2-/- mice were susceptible to ligature-induced\\nperiodontitis, and the protective effect of LIPUS on alveolar bone dysfunction\\nwas weaker in these mice. Activation of Nrf2 by LIPUS was accompanied by\\nactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. The oxidative defense function of LIPUS was\\ninhibited by exposure to LY294002 in vitro. Conclusions: These results\\ndemonstrated that LIPUS regulates alveolar bone homeostasis in periodontitis by\\nattenuating oxidative stress via the regulation of PI3K-Akt/Nrf2 signaling. Thus,\\nNrf2 plays a pivotal role in the protective effect exerted by LIPUS against\\nligature-induced experimental periodontitis.']]"

       "'OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine serum and salivary levels of neutrophil \\ngelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and evaluate NGAL correlation with key\\nanti-interleukin 10 (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory (IL-1β) cytokines in different\\nseverities of periodontal diseases. We also calculated the systemic inflammation \\nusing the periodontal inflamed surface area (PISA) to evaluate its correlation\\nwith NGAL in the study groups.\\nMETHODOLOGY: Eighty systemically healthy and non-smoking individuals were\\nseparated into four groups of 20: clinically healthy (Group 1), gingivitis (Group\\n2), stage I generalized periodontitis (Group 3, Grade A), and stage III\\ngeneralized periodontitis (Group 4, Grade A). Sociodemographic characteristics\\nand periodontal parameters were recorded, and PISA was calculated. The serum and \\nsalivary levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-10, and NGAL were determined using the\\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\\nRESULTS: We observed a significant increase in serum and salivary NGAL levels\\nfrom healthy to periodontitis groups (p=0.000). Group 2 presented significantly\\nhigher serum and salivary IL-10 levels and salivary IL-1β levels than Group 3\\n(p=0.000). Serum and salivary parameters (IL-1β, IL-10, and NGAL levels) were\\nstrongly positively correlated to periodontal parameters and PISA values\\n(p=0.000). Groups 2 and 3 showed overlapping PISA values.\\nCONCLUSION: The overlapping PISA values found in Groups 2 and 3 suggest that\\ngingivitis might progress to a systemic inflammatory burden somewhat comparable\\nto stage I periodontitis. This finding is supported by the higher serum and\\nsalivary cytokines/mediators levels in the gingivitis group than in stage I\\nperiodontitis group. Serum and salivary NGAL levels increased proportionally to\\ndisease severity and PISA. NGAL seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of\\nperiodontal disease, within the limitation of our study.'"

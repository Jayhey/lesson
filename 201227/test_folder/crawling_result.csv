A systematic review of the accuracy and efficiency of dental movements with Invisalign®.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31149604/,"We are currently living in an era where the use of computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing has allowed individualized orthodontic treatments, but has also incorporated enhanced digitalized technology that does not permit improvisation. The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze publications that assessed the accuracy and efficiency of the Invisalign® system. A systematic review was performed using a search strategy to identify articles that referenced Invisalign®, which were published between August 2007 and August 2017, and listed in the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and LILACS. Additionally, a manual search of clinical trials was performed in scientific journals and other databases. To rate the methodological quality of the articles, a grading system described by the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care was used, in combination with the Cochrane tool for risk of bias assessment. We selected 20 articles that met the inclusion criteria and excluded 5 due to excess biases. The level of evidence was high. Although it is possible to treat malocclusions with plastic systems, the results are not as accurate as those achieved by treatment with fixed appliances.","Lidia Galan-Lopez,Jorge Barcia-Gonzalez,Eliseo Plasencia","Clear aligners,Invisalign®,Invisible orthodontics,Treatment outcomes."

Clustering of craniofacial patterns in Korean children with snoring.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28670566/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the craniofacial patterns of Korean children with snoring and adenotonsillar hypertrophy (ATH) could be categorized into characteristic clusters according to age. Methods:We enrolled 236 children with snoring and ATH (age range, 5-12 years) in this study. They were subdivided into four age groups: 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, and 11-12 years. Based on cephalometric analysis, the sagittal and vertical skeletal patterns of each individual were divided into Class I, II, and III, as well as the normodivergent, hypodivergent, and hyperdivergent patterns, respectively. Cluster analysis was performed using cephalometric principal components in addition to the age factor. Results:Three heterogeneous clusters of craniofacial patterns were obtained in relation to age: cluster 1 (41.9%) included patients aged 5-8 years with a skeletal Class I or mild Class II and hyperdivergent pattern; cluster 2 (45.3%) included patients aged 9-12 years with a Class II and hyperdivergent pattern; and cluster 3 (12.8%) included patients aged 7-8 years with a Class III and hyperdivergent pattern. Conclusions:This study found that the craniofacial patterns of Korean children with snoring and ATH could be categorized into three characteristic clusters according to age groups. Although no significantly dominant sagittal skeletal discrepancy was observed, hyperdivergent vertical discrepancy was consistently evident in all clusters.","Stephanie Maritza Anderson,Hoi-Jeong Lim,Ki-Beom Kim,Sung-Wan Kim,Su-Jung Kim","Adenotonsillar hypertrophy,Cluster analysis,Craniofacial pattern,Snoring."
The effect of western adaptation of Hispanic-Americans on their assessment of Korean facial profiles.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24511513/,"Objective:To determine Korean facial profile preferences based on lip position as assessed by Hispanic-Americans of varying western adaptation levels and to determine whether the age and sex of the rater had any influence. Methods:For this study, 132 Hispanic-Americans and 68 Caucasians of varying age, sex and western adaptation levels volunteered to rate their preference of Korean male and female facial silhouettes having lips ranging from retruding to protruding. The Hispanic-Americans were also asked to complete a Bidimensional Acculturation Scale questionnaire to determine their western adaptation status: low-acculturated Hispanics (LAH; lesser western-adapted Hispanic participants) or high-acculturated Hispanics (HAH; higher western-adapted Hispanic participants). Results:The LAHs preferred significantly more retruded lip positions (p < 0.05) while HAHs showed some similarities with Caucasian participants in the results for the Korean male profile, even though HAHs preferred more retruded lip positions for the Korean female profile than Caucasians did (p < 0.05). The age and sex of raters did not influence the preference of facial profiles (p > 0.05). Conclusions:The results of this study suggest that Hispanic-Americans prefer a flatter Korean lip profile. It would be prudent for orthodontists to offer patients the option of altering lip profile through orthodontic and/or orthognathic surgery treatments.","Leo Toureno,Yoon-Ah Kook,Mohamed Bayome,Jae Hyun Park","Hispanic-American,Korean facial profile,Orthodontics,Western adaptation."
Predictors of midpalatal suture expansion by miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion in young adults: A preliminary study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31815104/,"Objective:We sought to determine the predictors of midpalatal suture expansion by miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion (MARPE) in young adults. Methods:The following variables were selected as possible predictors: chronological age, palate length and depth, midpalatal suture maturation (MPSM) stage, midpalatal suture density (MPSD) ratio, the sella-nasion (SN)-mandibular plane (MP) angle as an indicator of the vertical skeletal pattern, and the point A-nasion-point B (ANB) angle for anteroposterior skeletal classification. For 31 patients (mean age, 22.52 years) who underwent MARPE treatment, palate length and depth, MPSM stage and MPSD ratio from the initial cone-beam computed tomography images, and the SN-MP angle and ANB angle from lateral cephalograms were assessed. The midpalatal suture opening ratio was calculated from the midpalatal suture opening width measured in periapical radiographs and the MARPE screw expansion. Statistical analyses of correlations were performed for the entire patient group of 31 subjects and subgroups categorized by sex, vertical skeletal pattern, and anteroposterior skeletal classification. Results:In the entire patient group, the midpalatal suture opening ratio showed statistically significant negative correlations with age, palate length, and MPSM stage (r = -0.506, -0.494, and -0.746, respectively, allp< 0.01). In subgroup analyses, a strong negative correlation was observed with the palate depth in the skeletal Class II subgroup (r = -0.900,p< 0.05). Conclusions:The findings of this study indicated that age, palate length, and MPSM stage can be predictors of midpalatal suture expansion by MARPE in young adults.","Hyerin Shin,Chung-Ju Hwang,Kee-Joon Lee,Yoon Jeong Choi,Sang-Sun Han,Hyung Seog Yu","Adult treatment,Expansion,Miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion,Predictors."
Part I. What drives Korean adults to seek orthodontic treatment: Reliability and validity of a measurement instrument for the perception of orthodontic treatment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33144525/,"Objective:To develop a standardized instrument to measure the level of cognition for orthodontic treatment in adults, and verify its reliability and validity for assessing perceptions of orthodontic treatment in adults. Methods:A total of 406 adults aged 19-64 years were surveyed by an internet research system. A tool was developed through the instrument development and verification stages. The data were analyzed by correlation analysis, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and Cronbach's α test. Results:The instrument consisted of 11 items covering four factors related to orthodontic treatment. Three items were related to general perception, four described the perception of the treatment for adults, two related to the treatment effects, and two related to the retention of orthodontic treatment. In the reliability test, Cronbach's α was 0.845 for the 11 items. In assessments for individual components, Cronbach's α was 0.764 for the general perception of orthodontic treatment, 0.705 for the perception of this treatment for adults, 0.707 for the effects of the treatment, and 0.701 for the retention of orthodontic treatment. Finally, a measurement instrument for the perception of orthodontic treatment in adults was designed to assess the 11 items on a four-point Likert scale. Conclusions:This study developed a standard measurement instrument for assessing the perception of orthodontic treatment in adults. The proposed instrument will enable additional studies on the influence of an adult's perception of orthodontic treatment on the decision to undergo treatment.","Min-Hee Oh,Eun-A Kim,Ae-Hyun Park,MinSoo Kim,Jin-Hyoung Cho","Adult orthodontic treatment,Perception,Reliability,Validity."
Skeletal and dentoalveolar changes after miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion in young adults: A cone-beam computed tomography study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28337417/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the skeletal and dentoalveolar changes after miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion (MARPE) in young adults by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods:This retrospective study included 14 patients (mean age, 20.1 years; range, 16-26 years) with maxillary transverse deficiency treated with MARPE. Skeletal and dentoalveolar changes were evaluated using CBCT images acquired before and after expansion. Statistical analyses were performed using pairedt-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test according to normality of the data. Results:The midpalatal suture was separated, and the maxilla exhibited statistically significant lateral movement (p< 0.05) after MARPE. Some of the landmarks had shifted forwards or upwards by a clinically irrelevant distance of less than 1 mm. The amount of expansion decreased in the superior direction, with values of 5.5, 3.2, 2.0, and 0.8 mm at the crown, cementoenamel junction, maxillary basal bone, and zygomatic arch levels, respectively (p< 0.05). The buccal bone thickness and height of the alveolar crest had decreased by 0.6-1.1 mm and 1.7-2.2 mm, respectively, with the premolars and molars exhibiting buccal tipping of 1.1°-2.9°. Conclusions:Our results indicate that MARPE is an effective method for the correction of maxillary transverse deficiency without surgery in young adults.","Jung Jin Park,Young-Chel Park,Kee-Joon Lee,Jung-Yul Cha,Ji Hyun Tahk,Yoon Jeong Choi","Adults,Cone-beam computed tomography,Expansion,Miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion."
Characterization of dental phenotypes and treatment modalities in Korean patients with Parry-Romberg syndrome.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33144530/,"Objective:To investigate the dental phenotypes and treatment modalities (Tx- Mod) in Korean patients with Parry-Romberg syndrome (PRS) using longitudinal data. Methods:The samples consisted of 10 PRS patients, who were treated and/or followed-up at Seoul National University Dental Hospital between 1998 and 2019. Using a novel PRS severity index based on the numbers of the atrophy-involved area and asymmetry-involved item, we classified them into mild (n = 3), moderate (n = 2), and severe (n = 5). Dental phenotypes, including congenitally missing tooth (Con-Missing-Tooth), microdontia, tooth with short root (Short-Root), tooth with dilacerated root, and delayed eruption/impacted tooth, were investigated along with Tx-Mod. Results:The side of occurrence of all dental phenotypes showed 100% concordance with the side of PRS involvement. The most two common dental phenotypes were Con-Missing- Tooth and Short-Root (n = 29 and n = 17 in six patients). The sums of the average number of Con-Missing-Tooth and Short-Root increased from mild PRS to moderate PRS and severe PRS cases (1.0, 6.0, and 6.2). In terms of Tx- Mod, growth observation due to mild atrophy, fixed orthodontic treatment, and grafting were used for mild PRS cases. Tx-Mod for moderate PRS cases involved growth observation for surgery due to an early age at the initial visit. For severe PRS cases, diverse Tx-Mod combinations including unilateral functional appliance, fixed orthodontic treatment, growth observation, grafting, and orthognathic surgery were used. Conclusions:The novel PRS severity index may be useful to provide primary data for individualized diagnosis and treatment planning for PRS patients.","Sunjin Yim,Il-Hyung Yang,Seung-Hak Baek","Dental phenotype,Parry–Romberg syndrome,Parry–Romberg syndrome severity index,Treatment modality."
"Stability of dental, alveolar, and skeletal changes after miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28861393/,"Objective:Miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion (MARPE) is a means for expanding the basal bone without surgical intervention in young adults. Here, we assessed the differences in dental, alveolar, and skeletal measurements taken before (T0), immediately after (T1), and 1 year after (T2) MARPE. Methods:Twenty-four patients (mean age, 21.6 years) who had undergone MARPE and cone-beam computed tomography at T0, T1, and T2 were included. Changes in the following parameters were compared using pairedt-tests: intercusp, interapex, alveolar, nasal floor, and nasal cavity widths; inclination of the first molar (M1) and its alveolus; and thickness and height of the alveolar bone. A linear mixed-effects model was used to determine variables that affected periodontal changes in the M1. Results:MARPE produced significant increases in most measurements during T0-T2, despite relapse of some measurements during T1-T2. The alveolar thickness decreased on the buccal side, but increased on the palatal side. The alveolar crest level at the first premolar moved apically. Changes in the thickness and height of the alveolar bone were affected by the corresponding initial values. Conclusions:MARPE can be used as an effective tool for correcting maxillomandibular transverse discrepancy, showing stable outcomes 1 year after expansion.","Hyun-Mook Lim,Young-Chel Park,Kee-Joon Lee,Kyung-Ho Kim,Yoon Jeong Choi","Cone-beam computed tomography,Expansion,Miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion,Stability."
Resistance to sliding in orthodontics: misconception or method error? A systematic review and a proposal of a test protocol.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30003061/,"Resistance to sliding (RS) between the bracket, wire, and ligature has been largely debated in orthodontics. Despite the extensive number of published studies, the lack of discussion of the methods used has led to little understanding of this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to discuss variables affecting RS in orthodontics and to suggest an operative protocol. The search included PubMed©, Medline©, and the Cochrane Library©. References of full-text articles were manually analyzed. English-language articles published between January 2007 and January 2017 that performed anin vitroanalysis of RS between the bracket, wire, and ligature were included. Study methods were analyzed based on the study design, description of materials, and experimental setup, and a protocol to standardize the testing methods was proposed. From 404 articles identified from the database search and 242 records selected from published references, 101 were eligible for the qualitative analysis, and six for the quantitative synthesis. One or more experimental parameters were incompatible and a meta-analysis was not performed. Major factors regarding the study design, materials, and experimental setup were not clearly described by most studies. The normal force, that is the force perpendicular to the sliding of the wire and one of the most relevant variable in RS, was not considered by most studies. Different variables were introduced, often acting as confounding factors. A protocol was suggested to standardize testing procedures and enhance the understanding ofin vitrofindings.","Fabio Savoldi,Aggeliki Papoutsi,Simona Dianiskova,Domenico Dalessandri,Stefano Bonetti,James K H Tsoi,Jukka P Matinlinna,Corrado Paganelli","Biomaterial science,Bracket,Wire."

Methods:A total of 165,996 students (first grade [E1, 6-7 years of age], fourth grade [E4, 9-10 years], seventh grade [M1, 12-13 years], and tenth grade [H1, 15-16 years]) were selected by stratified sampling method and underwent the nationwide oral health examination performed by the Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea. The malocclusion assessments based on dentists' judgments were ""no malocclusion,"" ""needs orthodontic treatment (N-OTx),"" and ""under orthodontic treatment (U-OTx)."" The sum of N-OTx and U-OTx cases was determined as the number of students with malocclusion. After analyzing the prevalence of malocclusion according to grade, sex, and year-by-year differences, Pearson correlation analyses and two-way analyses of variance were performed. Results:The prevalence of malocclusion was 18.7%, which increased with the grades (E1 [8.3%] < E4 [15.8%] < M1 [22.9%] < H1 [25.3%],p< 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of malocclusion in each grade group for the period (p> 0.05) without significant correlation (E1, ρ = 0.129; E4, ρ = -0.495; M1, ρ = 0.406; H1, ρ = -0.383; allp> 0.05).

Comparison of inclination and vertical changes between single-wire and double-wire retraction techniques in lingual orthodontics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32042717/,"Objective:The Heat Induction Typodont System (HITS), used in some recent studies, has a distinct advantage over previous tooth movement simulation methods. This study aimed to compare inclination and vertical changes between the single-wire and double-wire techniques duringen masseretraction with different lengths of lever arms in lingual orthodontics using an upgraded version of the HITS. Methods:Duet lingual brackets, which have two main slots, were used in this study. Forty samples were divided into four groups according to the length of the lever arm (3-mm or 6-mm hook) and the retraction wire (single-wire or double-wire). Four millimeters ofen masseretraction was performed using lingual appliances. Thereafter, 3-dimensional-scanned images of the typodont were analyzed to measure inclination and vertical changes of the anterior teeth. Results:Incisor inclination presented more changes in the single-wire groups than in the double-wire groups. However, canine inclination did not differ between these groups. Regarding vertical changes, only the lateral incisors in the single-wire groups presented significantly larger values than did those in the double-wire groups. Combining the effect of hook lengths, among the four groups, the single-wire group with the 3-mm hook had the highest value, while the double-wire group with the 6-mm hook showed the least decrease in crown inclination and extrusion. Conclusions:The double-wire technique with an extended lever arm provided advantages over the single-wire technique with the same lever arm length in preventing torque loss and extrusion of the anterior teeth duringen masseretraction in lingual orthodontics.","Bui Quang Hung,Mihee Hong,Wonjae Yu,Hee-Moon Kyung","En masse retraction,Heat Induction Typodont,Lingual,Tooth movement."
Evaluation of the effects of miniscrew incorporation in palatal expanders for young adults using finite element analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29564217/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the stress distribution and displacement of various craniofacial structures after nonsurgical rapid palatal expansion (RPE) with conventional (C-RPE), bone-borne (B-RPE), and miniscrew-assisted (MARPE) expanders for young adults using three-dimensional finite element analysis (3D FEA). Methods:Conventional, bone-borne, and miniscrew-assisted palatal expanders were designed to simulate expansion in a 3D FE model created from a 20-year-old human dry skull. Stress distribution and the displacement pattern for each circumaxillary suture and anchor tooth were calculated. Results:The results showed that C-RPE induced the greatest stress along the frontal process of the maxilla and around the anchor teeth, followed by the suture area, whereas B-RPE generated the greatest stress around the miniscrew, although the area was limited within the suture. Compared with the other appliances, MARPE caused relatively even stress distribution, decreased the stress on the buccal plate of the anchor teeth, and reduced tipping of the anchor teeth. Conclusions:The findings of this study suggest that the incorporation of miniscrews in RPE devices may contribute to force delivery to the sutures and a decrease in excessive stress on the buccal plate. Thus, MARPE may serve as an effective modality for the nonsurgical treatment of transverse maxillary deficiency in young adults.","Eui-Hyang Seong,Sung-Hwan Choi,Hee-Jin Kim,Hyung-Seog Yu,Young-Chel Park,Kee-Joon Lee","Buccal plate,Circumaxillary sutures,Finite element analysis,MARPE."
Three-dimensional morphological evaluation of the hard palate in Korean adults with mild-to-moderate obstructive sleep apnea.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29732299/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the hard palate between Korean adults with and without mild-to-moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) using cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) data. Methods:The protocol for the two-dimensional (2D) and 3D mathematical modeling was established by analyzing CBCT images of 30 adults with OSA and 30 matched controls without OSA, using MIMICS software. The linear and angular measurements were also determined using this software. The measurements were repeated for 30 palates, by the same operator, to assess reliability. Results:The palates of OSA patients were higher in the posterior part and narrower in the anterior-superior part than those of the control group (p< 0.05). The nasal cavities of patients with OSA were narrower (p< 0.05) than those of controls. The increasing angle of the first molar palatal root is a compensation of the upper dental arch to improve occlusion. However, for most palatal measurements, there were no significant differences between the OSA and control groups (p> 0.05). The results of 2D and 3D mathematical models were consistent for linear and angular measurements, indicating that 2D and 3D mathematical modeling of the palate is a reliable methodology. Conclusions:OSA is a multifactorial disease; the palates of adults with mild-to-moderate OSA do not have specific morphological features distinct from those of healthy controls.","Chen Yu,Hyo-Won Ahn,Seong-Hun Kim","Cone-beam computed tomography,Hard palate,Morphology,Obstructive sleep apnea."
The six geometries revisited.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938828/,"Forces and moments delivered by a straight wire connecting two orthodontic brackets are statically indeterminate and cannot be estimated using the classical equations of static equilibrium. To identify the mechanics of such two-bracket systems, Burstone and Koenig used the principles of linear beam theory to estimate the resulting force systems. In the original publication, however, it remains unclear how the force systems were calculated because no reference or computational details on the underlying principles have been provided. Using the moment carry-over principle and the relative angulation of the brackets, a formula was derived to calculate the relative moments of the two brackets. Because of the moment equilibrium, the vertical forces that exist as a forcecouple on the two brackets can also be calculated. The accuracy of the proposed approach can be validated using previously published empirical data.","Austin Kang,Marino Musilli,Mauro Farella","Biomechanics,Bracket geometries,Orthodontics,Tooth movement."

The effectiveness of corticotomy and piezocision on canine retraction: A systematic review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29732306/,"The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness and complications of corticotomy and piezocision in canine retraction. Five electronic databases (PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Embase, and CENTRAL) were searched for articles published up to July 2017. The databases were searched for randomized control trials (RCTs), with a split-mouth design, using either corticotomy or piezocision. The primary outcome reported for canine retraction was either the amount of tooth movement, rate of tooth movement, or treatment time. The secondary outcome was complications. The selection process was based on the PRISMA guidelines. A risk of bias assessment was also performed. Our search retrieved 530 abstracts. However, only five RCTs were finally included. Corticotomy showed a more significant (i.e., 2 to 4 times faster) increase in the rate of tooth movement than did the conventional method. For piezocision, both accumulative tooth movement and rate of tooth movement were twice faster than those of the conventional method. Corticotomy (with a flap design avoiding marginal bone incision) or flapless piezocision procedures were not detrimental to periodontal health. Nevertheless, piezocision resulted in higher levels of patient satisfaction. The main limitation of this study was the limited number of primary research publications on both techniques. For canine retraction into the immediate premolar extraction site, the rate of canine movement after piezocision was almost comparable to that of corticotomy with only buccal flap elevation.","Nita Viwattanatipa,Satadarun Charnchairerk","Accelerated tooth movement,Corticotomy,Orthodontics,Piezocision."
Assessment of anterior-posterior jaw relationships in Korean adults using the nasion true vertical plane in cone-beam computed tomography images.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27226962/,"Objective:The aims of this study were to investigate a simple method for assessing anterior-posterior jaw relationships via cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images taken in the natural head position (NHP) relative to the nasion true vertical plane (NTVP), and measure normative data in Korean adults with normal profiles. Methods:Subjects were selected from patients presenting for third molar extraction and evaluated as having normal profiles by three examiners. The CBCT images of 80 subjects (39 males, 41 females) were taken in the NHP according to Solow and Tallgren's method. Linear measurements of the A-point, B-point, and Pog were calculated relative to the NTVP. Student's t-test was used to assess sexual differences in these measurements. Results:The mean linear measurements of the A-point, B-point, and Pog relative to the NTVP were 0.18 mm (standard deviation [SD], 4.77 mm), -4.00 mm (SD, 6.62 mm), and -2.49 mm (SD, 7.14 mm) respectively in Korean males, and 1.48 mm (SD, 4.21 mm), -4.07 mm (SD, 6.70 mm) and -2.91 mm (SD, 7.25 mm) in Korean females respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between Korean males and females (p < 0.05). Conclusions:Three-dimensional CBCT analysis using the NTVP is a simple and reliable method for assessing anterior-posterior skeletal relationships.","Youngju Park,Youngserk Cho,James Mah,Janghoon Ahn","Cone-beam computed tomography,Jaw relation,Nasion true vertical plane,Natural head position."
Palatal en-masse retraction of segmented maxillary anterior teeth: A finite element study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31149609/,"Objective:The aim of this finite element study was to clarify the mechanics of tooth movement in palatalen-masseretraction of segmented maxillary anterior teeth by using anchor screws and lever arms. Methods:A three-dimensional finite element method was used to simulate overall orthodontic tooth movements. The line of action of the force was varied by changing both the lever arm height and anchor screw position. Results:When the line of action of the force passed through the center of resistance (CR), the anterior teeth showed translation. However, when the line of action was not perpendicular to the long axis of the anterior teeth, the anterior teeth moved bodily with an unexpected intrusion even though the force was transmitted horizontally. To move the anterior teeth bodily without intrusion and extrusion, a downward force passing through the CR was necessary. When the line of action of the force passed apical to the CR, the anterior teeth tipped counterclockwise during retraction, and when the line of action of the force passed coronal to the CR, the anterior teeth tipped clockwise during retraction. Conclusions:The movement pattern of the anterior teeth changed depending on the combination of lever arm height and anchor screw position. However, this pattern may be unpredictable in clinical settings because the movement direction is not always equal to the force direction.","Jae Hyun Park,Yoon-Ah Kook,Yukio Kojima,Sunock Yun,Jong-Moon Chae","Anchor screw,Finite element study,Lever arm,Segmented palatal en-masse retraction."

Cone-beam computed tomography for the assessment of root-crown ratios of the maxillary and mandibular incisors in a Korean population.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28127538/,"Objective:This retrospective, cross-sectional study aimed to establish reference data for normal crown and root lengths and the root-crown ratios (R/C ratios) for the mature maxillary and mandibular incisors in a Korean population by using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods:We included 672 Korean patients (141 men and 531 women; mean age, 27.2 ± 7.7 years) who underwent CBCT examinations during various dental treatments. Crown and root lengths and the R/C ratios of the maxillary and mandibular incisors were measured using CBCT data, which were analyzed to detect significant differences between demographic factors as well as sagittal and vertical skeletal or occlusal relationships. Results:Teeth of the same type in each half-arch were symmetrical. The mean R/C ratios varied from 1.1 to 1.2 for the maxillary incisors and from 1.3 to 1.4 for the mandibular incisors. Crown and root lengths were greater in men than in women, regardless of tooth type. Root lengths and R/C ratios for the mandibular incisors were significantly greater in patients with skeletal Class II malocclusion or an excessive overjet than in the other patients. The R/C ratios for the mandibular incisors were lower in patients with an open bite than in those with a normal or deep bite. Moreover, the R/C ratios for the mandibular incisors increased with age. Conclusions:The data obtained in our study can serve as reference values for crown and root lengths and the R/C ratios for the maxillary and mandibular incisors in the Korean population.","Sung-Hwan Choi,Jung-Suk Kim,Cheol-Soon Kim,Hyung-Seog Yu,Chung-Ju Hwang","Cone-beam computed tomography,Incisor,Population,Tooth crown,Tooth root."

Application of the foramina of the trigeminal nerve as landmarks for analysis of craniofacial morphology.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31598489/,"Objective:The objective of this study was to develop new parameters based on the foramina of the trigeminal nerve and to compare them with the conventional cephalometric parameters in different facial skeletal types. Methods:Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and cephalograms from 147 adult patients (57 males and 90 females; mean age, 26.1 years) were categorized as Class I (1° < ANB < 3°), Class II (ANB > 5°), and Class III (ANB < -1°). Seven foramina in the craniofacial area-foramen rotundum (Rot), foramen ovale (Ov), infraorbital foramen, greater palatine foramen, incisive foramen (IF), mandibular foramen (MDF), and mental foramen (MTF)-were identified in the CBCT images. Various linear, angular, and ratio parameters were compared between the groups by using the foramina, and the relationship between the new parameters and the conventional cephalometric parameters was assessed. Results:The distances between the foramina in the cranial base did not differ among the three groups. However, the Rot-IF length was shorter in female Class III patients, while the Ov-MTF length, MDF-MTF length, and Ov-MDF length were shorter in Class II patients than in Class III patients of both sexes. The MDF-MTF/FH plane angle was larger in Class II patients than in Class III patients of both sexes. Most parameters showed moderate to high correlations, but the Ov-MDF-MTF angle showed a relatively low correlation with the gonial angle. Conclusions:The foramina of the trigeminal nerve can be used to supplement assessments based on the conventional skeletal landmarks on CBCT images.","Ba-Da Lim,Dong-Soon Choi,Insan Jang,Bong-Kuen Cha","Anatomy,Computed tomography,Foramen,Trigeminal nerve."
"Distribution, side involvement, phenotype and associated anomalies of Korean patients with craniofacial clefts from single university hospitalbased data obtained during 1998-2018.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33144527/,"Objective:To investigate the distribution, side involvement, phenotype, and associated anomalies of Korean patients with craniofacial clefts (CFC). Methods:The samples consisted of 38 CFC patients, who were treated at Seoul National University Dental Hospital during 1998-2018. The Tessier cleft type, sex, side involvement, phenotype, and associated anomalies were investigated using nonparametric statistical analysis. Results:The three most common types were #7 cleft, followed by #0 cleft and #14 cleft. There was no difference between the frequency of male and female. Patients with #0 cleft exhibited nasal deformity, bony defect, and missing teeth in the premaxilla, midline cleft lip, and eye problems. A patient with #3 cleft (unilateral type) exhibited bilateral cleft lip and alveolus. All patients with #4 cleft were the bilateral type, including a combination of #3 and #4 clefts, and had multiple missing teeth. A patient with #5 cleft (unilateral type) had a posterior openbite. In patients with #7 cleft, the unilateral type was more prevalent than the bilateral type (87.0% vs. 13.0%, p < 0.001). Sixteen patients showed hemifacial microsomia (HFM), Goldenhar syndrome, and unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP). There was a significant match in the side involvement of #7 cleft and HFM (87.5%,p< 0.01). Patients with #14 cleft had plagiocephaly, UCLP, or hyperterorbitism. A patient with #30 cleft exhibited tongue tie and missing tooth. Conclusions:Due to the diverse associated craniofacial anomalies in patients with CFC, a multidisciplinary approach involving a well-experienced cooperative team is mandatory for these patients.","Jee Hyeok Chung,Sunjin Yim,Il-Sik Cho,Seung-Weon Lim,Il-Hyung Yang,Jeong Hyun Ha,Sukwha Kim,Seung-Hak Baek","Associated anomalies,Craniofacial clefts,Distribution,Phenotype."
Outcomes of comprehensive fixed appliance orthodontic treatment: A systematic review with meta-analysis and methodological overview.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29090128/,"Objective:The aim of this systematic review was to assess the occlusal outcome and duration of fixed orthodontic therapy from clinical trials in humans with the Objective Grading System (OGS) proposed by the American Board of Orthodontics. Methods:Nine databases were searched up to October 2016 for prospective/retrospective clinical trials assessing the outcomes of orthodontic therapy with fixed appliances. After duplicate study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment according to the Cochrane guidelines, random-effects meta-analyses of the mean OGS score and treatment duration were performed and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results:A total of 34 relevant clinical trials including 6,207 patients (40% male, 60% female; average age, 18.4 years) were identified. The average OGS score after treatment was 27.9 points (95% CI, 25.3-30.6 points), while the average treatment duration was 24.9 months (95% CI, 24.6-25.1 months). There was no significant association between occlusal outcome and treatment duration, while considerable heterogeneity was identified. In addition, orthodontic treatment involving extraction of four premolars appeared to have an important effect on both outcomes and duration of treatment. Finally, only 10 (39%) of the identified studies matched compared groups by initial malocclusion severity, although meta-epidemiological evidence suggested that matching may have significantly influenced their results. Conclusions:The findings from this systematic review suggest that the occlusal outcomes of fixed appliance treatment vary considerably, with no significant association between treatment outcomes and duration. Prospective matched clinical studies that use the OGS tool are needed to compare the effectiveness of orthodontic appliances.","Spyridon N Papageorgiou,Damian Höchli,Theodore Eliades","Meta-analysis,Orthodontics,Treatment duration,Treatment outcome."
Influence of changing various parameters in miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion: A three-dimensional finite element analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31149605/,"Objective:This study aimed to analyze the effect of changing various parameters of the bone-borne rapid palatal expander (RPE) using the finite element method (FEM). Methods:In eight experimental groups, we investigated the effect of the number, position, and length of miniscrews; positional changes of the expander; and changes in the hook length on maxillary expansion. In finite element analysis, we compared the magnitude and distribution of stress, and the displacement changes following expansion of the bone-borne RPE. Results:When we compared the number and position of miniscrews, placing miniscrews in the anterior and posterior sides was advantageous for maxillary expansion in terms of stress distribution and displacement changes. Miniscrew length did not significantly affect stress distribution and displacement changes. Furthermore, anteroposterior displacement of the expander did not significantly affect transverse maxillary expansion but had various effects on vertical changes of the maxilla. The maxilla rotated clockwise when the miniscrews were placed in the anterior region. The hook length of the expander did not show consistent results in terms of changes in stress distribution and magnitude or in displacement changes. Conclusions:The findings of this study suggest that changes in the location and length of the miniscrews and displacement of the bone-borne RPE could affect the pattern of the maxillary expansion, depending on the combination of these factors.","Soungjun Yoon,Dong-Yul Lee,Seok-Ki Jung","Bone-borne rapid palatal expander,Finite element method,Miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expander."
Effects of reversing the coiling direction on the force-deflection characteristics of nickel-titanium closed-coil springs.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31367576/,"Objective:To investigate the effects of reversing the coiling direction of nickeltitanium closed-coil springs (NiTi-CCSs) on the force-deflection characteristics. Methods:The samples consisted of two commercially available conventional NiTi-CCS groups and two reverse-wound NiTi-CCS groups (Ormco-Conventional vs. Ormco-Reverse; GAC-Conventional vs. GAC-Reverse; n = 20 per group). The reverse-wound NiTi-CCSs were directly made from the corresponding conventional NiTi-CCSs by reversing the coiling direction. Tensile tests were performed for each group in a temperature-controlled acrylic chamber (37 ± 1℃). After measuring the force level, the range of the deactivation force plateau (DFP) and the amount of mechanical hysteresis (MH), statistical analyses were performed. Results:The Ormco-Reverse group exhibited a significant shift of the DFP end point toward the origin point (2.3 to 0.6 mm), an increase in the force level (1.2 to 1.3 N) and amount of MH (1.0 to 1.5 N) compared to the Ormco-Conventional group (allp< 0.001), which indicated that force could be constantly maintained until the end of the deactivation curve. In contrast, the GAC-Reverse group exhibited a significant shift of the DFP-end point away from the origin point (0.2 to 3.3 mm), a decrease in the force level (1.1 to 0.9 N) and amount of MH (0.6 to 0.4 N) compared to the GAC-Conventional group (allp< 0.001), which may hinder the maintenance of force until the end of the deactivation curve.

The influence of age on lip-line cant in adults: a cross-sectional study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27019822/,"Objective:The aims of this study were to assess the direction and degree of lip-line cant in Korean adult orthodontic patients and to identify the effects of sex and age on changes in the cant severity. Methods:In this cross-sectional retrospective study, lip-line cant was measured in the frontal photographs of 585 Korean patients (92 men and 493 women) aged 18-48 years. The outcome variables (direction and degree of lip-line cant) were assessed in terms of predictor variables (sex, age, sagittal skeletal relationship, and menton deviation angle). Results:The direction of lip-line cant did not differ according to sex, age, or skeletal classification. Patients had 1.6° of lip-line cant on average before orthodontic treatment. Middle-aged adults displayed a significant trend toward a lower degree of lip-line cant compared to younger adults (p < 0.01). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the degree of lip-line cant was weakly negatively correlated with age (p < 0.001). Conclusions:While the direction of lip-line cant did not differ according to the parameters explored here, the degree of cant was correlated with age in adults, independent of menton deviation. Specifically, middle-aged adults tended to display significantly lower degrees of lip-line cant than did younger adults.","Sung Hwan Choi,Jung Suk Kim,Cheol Soon Kim,Chung Ju Hwang","Adults,Age,Lip-line cant,Menton deviation."

Methods:A total of 187 periodontally healthy subjects (121 females and 66 males) who presented at the Faculty of Dentistry in Yüzüncü Yıl University for orthodontic treatment were enrolled in the study. The individuals involved in the study were divided into three groups; Angle Class I malocclusion, Angle Class II malocclusion, and Angle Class III malocclusion. Each group was classified as mild, moderate, or severe according to the level of crowding. WKG was determined as the distance between the mucogingival junction and the free gingival margin. GT was determined by the transgingival probing technique. Factorial variance analysis and the Duncan multiple comparison test were employed to identify the extent to which a difference was apparent between the groups according to these parameters. Results:It was determined that teeth in the mandibular anterior region display the thin gingival biotype. WKG and GT were observed as being higher at the mandibular incisor teeth in the severe crowding group and at the mandibular canine teeth in the mild crowding group. The GT of the mandibular right central and lateral incisors was found to be thinner in the Angle Class III group.

A survey on retention practice among orthodontists in Malaysia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26877981/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate retention practices commonly employed by orthodontists. The objectives were to identify the types of retainer frequently used and to investigate the variations in retention practice. Methods:A total of 97 orthodontists were randomly selected, and a questionnaire consisting of 25 multiple-choice questions sent to them by mail. Upon receiving of the completed questionnaires, the data were statistically analyzed. Results:A total of 32 responses were received; among these, 59.4% of orthodontists' practiced is in a government setting and 40.6% were in private practice. A vacuum-formed retainer was the most commonly used removable retainer for both maxillary (46.9%) and mandibular (46.9%) arches, followed by a Hawley retainer (maxilla, 43.8%; mandible, 37.5%), and a fixed retainer (maxilla, 3.1%; mandible, 9.4%). Of the responding orthodontists, 78.1% prescribed full-time wear (more than 20 h per day) for a duration of 3-9 months for a maxillary arch, compared to 71.9% for the mandibular arch. Only 18.8% of the orthodontists prescribed part-time wear of the retainer for the maxillary arch, compared to 21.9% for the mandibular arch. The majority of orthodontists did not instruct their patients to stop wearing removable retainers (71.9%) or fixed retainers (66.8%) at any specific time and they preferred their patients to continue wearing retainers. Conclusions:Vacuum-formed retainers are the most commonly used retainers among orthodontists. The majority of orthodontists prescribed full-time wear for more than 20 h per day with a duration of 3-9 months and preferred indefinite use of the retainer.","Norma Ab Rahman,Tze Fui Low,Nur Shaheera Idris","Hawley retainer,Retention practice,Vacuum-formed retainer."
Three-dimensional evaluation of the correlation between lip canting and craniofacial planes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632045/,"Objective:This study aimed to analyze the correlation of horizontal and sagittal planes used in two-dimensional diagnosis with lip canting by using threedimensional (3D) analysis. Methods:Fifty-two patients (25 men, 27 women; average age: 24 years) undergoing treatment for dentofacial deformity were enrolled. Computed tomography images were acquired, and digital imaging and communication in medicine files were reconstructed into a 3D virtual model wherein horizontal and sagittal craniofacial planes were measured. Subsequently, the correlations of lip canting with these horizontal and sagittal planes were investigated. Results:The mandibular symmetry plane, the occlusal plane, Camper's plane, the mandibular plane, Broadbent's plane, and the nasal axis plane were correlated with the amount of lip canting (Pearson's correlation coefficients: 0.761, 0.648, 0.556, 0.526, 0.438, and 0.406, respectively). Planes associated with the lower part of the face showed the strongest correlations; the strength of the correlations decreased in the midfacial and cranial regions. None of the planes showed statistically significant differences between patients with clinical lip canting (> 3°) and those without prominent lip canting. Conclusions:The findings of this study suggest that lip canting is strongly correlated with the mandibular symmetry plane, which includes menton deviation.

Effects of pre-applied orthodontic force on the regeneration of periodontal tissues in tooth replantation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31598486/,"Objective:This study aimed to investigate the effect of pre-applied orthodontic force on the regeneration of periodontal ligament (PDL) tissues and the underlying mechanisms in tooth replantation. Methods:Orthodontic force (50 cN) was applied to the left maxillary first molars of 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 32); the right maxillary first molars were left untreated to serve as the control group. After 7 days, the first molars on both sides were fully luxated and were immediately replanted in their original sockets. To verify the effects of the pre-applied orthodontic force, we assessed gene expression by using microarray analysis and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), cell proliferation by using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunofluorescence staining, and morphological changes by using histological analysis. Results:Application of orthodontic force for 7 days led to the proliferation of PDL tissues, as verified on microarray analysis and PCNA staining. Histological analysis after replantation revealed less root resorption, a better arrangement of PDL fibers, and earlier regeneration of periodontal tissues in the experimental group than in the control group. For the key genes involved in periodontal tissue remodeling, includingCXCL2,CCL4,CCL7,MMP3,PCNA,OPG, andRUNX2, quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that messenger RNA levels were higher at 1 or 2 weeks in the experimental group. Conclusions:These results suggest that the application of orthodontic force prior to tooth replantation enhanced the proliferation and activities of PDL cells and may lead to higher success rates with fewer complications.","Won-Young Park,Min Soo Kim,Min-Seok Kim,Min-Hee Oh,Su-Young Lee,Sun-Hun Kim,Jin-Hyoung Cho","Ankylosis,Orthodontic force,Periodontal ligament,Replantation."

Diagnostic methods for assessing maxillary skeletal and dental transverse deficiencies: A systematic review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27668196/,"Objective:To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the diagnostic tools available for assessing maxillary transverse deficiencies. Methods:An electronic search of three databases was performed from their date of establishment to April 2015, with manual searching of reference lists of relevant articles. Articles were considered for inclusion if they reported the accuracy or reliability of a diagnostic method or evaluation technique for maxillary transverse dimensions in mixed or permanent dentitions. Risk of bias was assessed in the included articles, using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool-2. Results:Nine articles were selected. The studies were heterogeneous, with moderate to low methodological quality, and all had a high risk of bias. Four suggested that the use of arch width prediction indices with dental cast measurements is unreliable for use in diagnosis. Frontal cephalograms derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were reportedly more reliable for assessing intermaxillary transverse discrepancies than posteroanterior cephalograms. Two studies proposed new three-dimensional transverse analyses with CBCT images that were reportedly reliable, but have not been validated for clinical sensitivity or specificity. No studies reported sensitivity, specificity, positive or negative predictive values or likelihood ratios, or ROC curves of the methods for the diagnosis of transverse deficiencies. Conclusions:Current evidence does not enable solid conclusions to be drawn, owing to a lack of reliable high quality diagnostic studies evaluating maxillary transverse deficiencies. CBCT images are reportedly more reliable for diagnosis, but further validation is required to confirm CBCT's accuracy and diagnostic superiority.","Dena Sawchuk,Kris Currie,Manuel Lagravere Vich,Juan Martin Palomo,Carlos Flores-Mir","Cone-beam computed tomography,Diagnosis,Maxillary transverse deficiency,Systematic review."
Dentofacial transverse development in Koreans according to skeletal maturation: A cross-sectional study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29291187/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to establish the normative data of dentofacial transverse dimensions according to the skeletal maturation stage in Korean adolescents with good occlusion, assess gender differences and determine correlations between transverse variables. Methods:A total of 577 Korean subjects between ages 7 to 19 years and exhibiting skeletal Class I occlusion were categorized by skeletal maturation index (SMI) of Fishman using hand-wrist radiographs. Dentofacial transverse dimensions were assessed using posteroanterior cephalograms. Independent two-samplet-tests were used to analyze differences between genders. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlation between transverse measurements. Results:Dentofacial transverse norms relevant to skeletal maturation stages were established. The average maxillomandibular width difference and ratio at growth completion was 22.16 mm and 77.01% for males; 23.70 mm and 74.06% for females, respectively. Males had greater facial, maxillary and mandibular widths compared to females at every SMI stage. The maxillary and mandibular intermolar widths showed the strongest correlation for both sexes (r = 0.826 for males, r = 0.725 for females). Conclusions:Dentofacial transverse norms of Korean adolescents were established according to developmental stage. All dentofacial widths were greater in males at growth completion. Maxillary and mandibular intermolar widths were strongly correlated. This study may serve as a guideline for the assessment of dentofacial transverse growth according to skeletal maturation stage in Korean adolescents with good occlusion.","Soonshin Hwang,Yoonjeong Noh,Yoon Jeong Choi,Chooryung Chung,Hye Sun Lee,Kyung-Ho Kim","Growth and development,Posteroanterior cephalometrics,Skeletal maturation,Transverse development."
Effects of a new type of clear overlay retainer on occlusal contacts.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28523247/,"The popularity of clear overlay retainers (CORs) has increased recently because of their advantages such as better esthetics, cost effectiveness, easy fabrication, and good compliance. However, a deficiency in posterior occlusal settling is a reported limitation of CORs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the posterior occlusal contact changes in a new type of clear orthodontic retainer called Oral-treaper (OTP), which consists of three layers and has stronger mechanical characteristics than do conventional retainers. Three patients who completed fixed orthodontic treatment received OTP as a removable retainer. Cast models were fabricated after the removal of fixed appliances (T1) and after 4 to 11 months of using the retainers (T2). We evaluated all the cast models to compare the post-orthodontic settling pattern during the use of the OTPs. The depth of occlusal contacts was evaluated using color maps. The OTP did not prevent vertical settling in all patients but resulted in an improvement in posterior occlusal contact points.","Kyoung Yeon Kim,Hyo-Won Ahn,Seong-Hun Kim,Gerald Nelson","Clear overlay retainer,Occlusal contacts,Settling."

Surgical approach and orthodontic treatment of mandibular condylar osteochondroma.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32475848/,"Osteochondroma is a common benign tumor of bones, but it is rare in the mandibular condyle. With its outgrowth it manifests clinically as deviation of the mandible limitation of mouth opening, and facial asymmetry. After the tumor is diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and radiographic examination including cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) analysis, an appropriate surgery and treatment plan should be formulated. Herein, we present the case of a 44-year-old female patient who visited our dental hospital because her chin point had been deviating to the left side slowly but progressively over the last 3 years and she had difficulty masticating. Based on CBCT, she was diagnosed with skeletal Class III malocclusion accompanied by osteochondroma of the right mandibular condyle. Maxillary occlusal cant with the right side down was observed, but it was confirmed to be an extrusion of the molars associated with dental compensation. Therefore, after intrusion of the right molars with the use of temporary anchorage devices, sagittal split ramus osteotomy was used to remove the tumor and perform orthognathic surgery simultaneously. During 6 months after the surgery, continuous bone resorption and remodeling were observed in the condyle of the affected side, which led to a change in occlusion. During the postoperative orthodontic treatment, intrusive force and buccal torque were applied to the molars on the affected side, and a proper buccal overjet was created. After 18 months, CBCT revealed that the rate of bone absorption was continuously reduced, bone corticalization appeared, and good occlusion and a satisfying facial profile were achieved.","So Jin Yang,Nam Hyung Chung,Jong Ghee Kim,Young-Mi Jeon","Condyle remodeling,Osteochondroma."

L-PRP was injected submucosally at the buccal and lingual areas of the first premolar in one random side of the maxilla and the other side served as the control and received normal saline. The amount of tooth movement was assessed on three-dimensional digital models on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Histological findings and osteoclast numbers were examined on day 0 as the baseline and on days 7, 14, and 28. Results:The L-PRP group showed significantly greater cumulative tooth movement at all observed periods. However, a significantly higher rate of tooth movement was observed only on days 0-7 and 7-14. The osteoclast numbers were significantly increased in the L-PRP group on days 7 and 14. Conclusions:Local injection of L-PRP resulted in a transient increase in the rate of tooth movement and higher osteoclast numbers.","Theerasak Nakornnoi,Chidchanok Leethanakul,Bancha Samruajbenjakun","Leukocyte-platelet-rich plasma,Orthodontics,Tooth movement."
Biomechanical considerations for uprighting impacted mandibular molars.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632046/,"This case report demonstrates two different uprighting mechanics separately applied to mesially tipped mandibular first and second molars. The biomechanical considerations for application of these mechanisms are also discussed. For repositioning of the first molar, which was severely tipped and deeply impacted, a novel cantilever mechanics was used. The molar tube was bonded in the buccolingual direction to facilitate insertion of a cantilever from the buccal side. By twisting the distal end of the cantilever, sufficient uprighting moment was generated. The mesial end of the cantilever was hooked over the miniscrew placed between the canine and first premolar, which could prevent exertion of an intrusive force to the anterior portion of the dentition as a side effect. For repositioning of the second molar, an uprighting mechanics using a compression force with two step bends incorporated into a nickel-titanium archwire was employed. This generated an uprighting moment as well as a distal force acting on the tipped second molar to regain the lost space for the first molar and bring it into its normal position. This epoch-making uprighting mechanics could also minimize the extrusion of the molar, thereby preventing occlusal interference by increasing interocclusal clearance between the inferiorly placed two step bends and the antagonist tooth. Consequently, the two step bends could help prevent occlusal interference. After 2 years and 11 months of active treatment, a desirable Class I occlusion was successfully achieved without permanent tooth extraction.","Yukiko Morita,Yoshiyuki Koga,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Noriaki Yoshida","Impacted molars,Mechanics,Orthodontic implant,Orthodontic treatment."
Antifibrotic effects of sulforaphane treatment on gingival elasticity reduces orthodontic relapse after rotational tooth movement in beagle dogs.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33144528/,"Objective:Increased gingival elasticity has been implicated as the cause of relapse following orthodontic rotational tooth movement and approaches to reduce relapse are limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of sulforaphane (SFN), an inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis, on gene expression in gingival fibroblasts and relapse after rotational tooth movement in beagle dogs. Methods:The lower lateral incisors of five beagle dogs were rotated. SFN or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were injected into the supra-alveolar gingiva of the experimental and control group, respectively, and the effect of SFN on relapse tendency was evaluated. Changes in mRNA expression of extracellular matrix components associated with gingival elasticity in beagles were investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Morphology and arrangement of collagen fibers were observed on Masson's trichrome staining of buccal gingival tissues of experimental and control teeth. Results:SFN reduced the amount and percentage of relapse of orthodontic rotation. It also decreased the gene expression of lysyl oxidase and increased the gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 andMMP12, compared with DMSO control subjects. Histologically, collagen fiber bundles were arranged irregularly and were not well connected in the SFN-treated group, whereas the fibers extended in parallel and perpendicular directions toward the gingiva and alveolar bone in a more regular and well-ordered arrangement in the DMSO-treated group. Conclusions:Our findings demonstrated that SFN treatment may be a promising pharmacologic approach to prevent orthodontic rotational relapse caused by increased gingival elasticity of rotated teeth in beagle dogs.","Kyong-Nim Kim,Jue-Young Kim,Jung-Yul Cha,Sung-Hwan Choi,Jin Kim,Sung-Won Cho,Chung-Ju Hwang","Gingival elasticity,Relapse,Rotation,Sulforaphane."

Prognostic factors associated with the success rates of posterior orthodontic miniscrew implants: A subgroup meta-analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27019826/,"Objective:To systematically review previous studies and to assess, via a subgroup meta-analysis, the combined odds ratio (OR) of prognostic factors affecting the success of miniscrew implants (MIs) inserted into the buccal posterior region. Methods:Three electronic searches that were limited to articles on clinical human studies using MIs that were published in English prior to March 2015 were conducted. The outcome measure was the success of MIs. Patient factors included age, sex, and jaw of insertion (maxilla vs. mandible), while the MI factors included length and diameter. A meta-analysis was performed on 17 individual studies. The quality of each study was assessed for non-randomized studies and quantified using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The meta-analysis outcome was a combined OR. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses based on the study design, study quality, and sample size of miniscrews implanted were performed. Results:Significantly higher success rates were revealed for MIs inserted in the maxilla, for patients ≥ 20 years of age, and for long MIs (≥ 8 mm) and MIs with a large diameter (> 1.4 mm). All subgroups acquired homogeneity, and the combined OR of the prospective studies (OR, 3.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.10-6.44) was significantly higher in the maxilla than that in the retrospective studies (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.60-2.74).

Effectiveness of anchorage with temporary anchorage devices during anterior maxillary tooth retraction: A randomized clinical trial.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31598484/,"Objective:This study evaluated the efficiency of anchorage provided by temporary anchorage devices (TADs) in maxillary bicuspid extraction cases during retraction of the anterior teeth using a fixed appliance. Methods:Patients aged 12 to 50 years with malocclusion for which bilateral first or second maxillary bicuspid extractions were indicated were included in the study and randomly allocated to the TAD or control groups. Retraction of the anterior teeth was achieved using skeletal anchorage in the TAD group and conventional dental anchorage in the control group. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed after alignment of teeth, and a second CT scan was performed at the end of extraction space closure in both groups. A three-dimensional superimposition was performed to visualize and quantify the maxillary first molar movement during the retraction phase, which was the primary outcome, and the stability of TAD movement, which served as the secondary outcome. Results:Thirty-four patients (17 in each group) underwent the final analysis. The two groups showed a significant difference in the movement of the first maxillary molars, with less significant anchorage loss in the TAD group than that in the control group. In addition, TAD movement showed only a slight mesial movement on the labial side. On the palatal side, the mesial TAD movement was greater. Conclusions:In comparison with conventional dental anchorage, TADs can be considered an efficient source of anchorage during retraction of maxillary anterior teeth. TADs remain stable when correctly placed in the bone during the anterior tooth retraction phase.","Stéphane Barthélemi,Alban Desoutter,Fatoumata Souaré,Frédéric Cuisinier","Anchorage,En masse retraction,Randomized clinical trial,Temporary anchorage devices."

Methods:The following four MIM bracket series with 0.022-inch (in) slots were selected for investigation: Di MIM mini Twin (Ortho Organizers), Mini Diamond Roth (Ormco), Gemini MBT (3M Unitek), and Formula R Roth (Tomy). The following four CNC bracket series with 0.022-in slots were selected for investigation: Econoline MBT (Adenta), Legend mini MBT (GC Orthodontics), Crown mini MBT (Adenta), and Evolve MBT (DB Orthodontics). The slot dimensions were measured using an optical microscope (XTCam-D310M; Mitutoyo) with a resolution of 1 μm. The results were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and the Tukeypost-hoctest with a significance level of 0.05. Results:The results indicated that all the investigated slot sizes were oversized with respect to the manufacturers' specifications (0.022 in). Among the eight bracket series, the Di MIM bracket (MIM) was the most oversized by 10.4%, whereas the Evolve bracket (CNC) was the least oversized by 2.6%. The slots in seven of the bracket series had divergent walls instead of parallel ones. The Evolve bracket alone had parallel slot walls. Conclusions:Regardless of the manufacturing method, all the slot sizes of the brackets investigated in this study were significantly oversized; most of the slot walls were nonparallel, except for those of the Evolve bracket. This study could not establish that the CNC method was more accurate than the MIM method in manufacturing bracket slots.","Jae-Sung Park,In-Tae Song,Jae-Hee Bae,Soo-Min Gil,Kyung-Hwa Kang","Computerized numerical control,Metal injection molding,Slot parallelism,Slot size."

Methods:The sample consisted of 10 patients (mean age, 23.2 years; range, 18.0-27.8 years; 8 males, 2 females) who underwent two-jaw orthognathic surgery. A three-dimensional imaging program (Invivo 5) was used with multidetector computed tomography images taken preand postoperatively (obtained 32.3 ± 6.0 days before surgery and 5.8 ± 2.6 days after surgery, respectively) for the measurement of bone densities at the following sites: (1) alveolar bone in the maxilla and mandible, (2) extra-alveolar sites, such as the top of the head, menton (Me), condyle, and the fourth cervical vertebrae (C4). Results:When pre- and postsurgical bone densities were compared, an overall tendency of decrease in bone density was noted. Statistically significant reductions were observed in the densities of cancellous bone at several areas of the maxillary alveolar bone; cortical and cancellous bone in most areas of the mandibular alveolar bone; cortical bone in Me; and cancellous bone in C4. There was no statistically significant difference in bone density in relation to the depth of the alveolar bone. In a comparison of the bone densities between groups with and without genioplasty, there was almost no statistically significant difference.

The purpose of this study was to compare measurements recorded on three-dimensional (3D) cephalograms constructed from two-dimensional conventional radiographs and biplanar radiographs generated using a new biplanar imaging system with those recorded on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-generated cephalograms in order to evaluate the accuracy of the 3D cephalograms generated using the biplanar imaging system. Methods:Three sets of lateral and frontal radiographs of 15 human dry skulls with prominent facial asymmetry were obtained using conventional radiography, the biplanar imaging system, and CBCT. To minimize errors in the construction of 3D cephalograms, fiducial markers were attached to anatomical landmarks prior to the acquisition of radiographs. Using the 3D Ceph™ program, 3D cephalograms were constructed from the images obtained using the biplanar imaging system (3D cephbiplanar), conventional radiography (3D cephconv), and CBCT (3D cephcbct).

Periodontal ligament proliferation and expressions of bone biomolecules upon orthodontic preloading: Clinical implications for tooth autotransplantation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32475846/,"Objective:Preservation of the periodontal ligament (PDL) is vital to the success of tooth autotransplantation (TAT). Increased PDL volumes and facilitated tooth extraction have been observed upon orthodontic preloading. However, it is unclear whether any changes occur in the expressions of bone biomolecules in the increased PDL volumes. This study aimed to determine the expressions of runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in PDL upon preloading. Methods:Seventy-two premolars from 18 patients were randomly assigned to experimental groups that received a leveling force for 1, 2, or 4 weeks or to a control unloaded group. Following extraction, PDL volumes from 32 premolars of eight patients (21.0 ± 3.8 years) were evaluated using toluidine blue staining. The expressions of the biomolecules in the PDL from 40 premolars of ten patients (21.4 ± 4.0 years) were analyzed via immunoblotting. Results:The median percentage of stained PDL was significantly higher at 2 and 4 weeks after preloading than in the unloaded condition (p< 0.05).

Methods:The model of the mandible and teeth were used to build a finite element analysis model, and a mini-plate was inserted in the mandibular ramus. Two different orthodontic forces were established for displacement of mandibular molars. Orthodontic forces were applied at the level of the bracket and at the level of the cemento-enamel junction in the mandibular canine respectively. Results:orthodontic forces at the level of the cemento-enamel junction resulted in a greater biomechanical bodily movement in distalization of the mandibular molars compared to when the orthodontic forces were applied at the level of the bracket. Applying orthodontic forces to the cemento-enamel junction also resulted in unwanted greater extrusive movements in distalization of the mandibular molars compared to the bracket level. Conclusions:With considering the mode of orthodontic teeth movement, applying different vertical orthodontic forces for distalization of mandibular molars can lead to more effective distalization of teeth.","Myungsoon Park,Yonghyun Na,Minbong Park,Janghoon Ahn","Distalization,Finite element analysis,Mandibular molars,Mini-plate."

Results:The distribution of maturation stages of the midpalatal suture according to the cervical vertebrae maturation index was highly variable, and there was a strong negative correlation between maturation stage and fractal dimension (-0.623, p < 0.001). Fractal dimension was a statistically significant indicator of dichotomous results with regard to maturation stage (area under curve = 0.794, p < 0.001). A test in which fractal dimension was used to predict the resulting variable that splits maturation stages into ABC and D or E yielded an optimal fractal dimension cut-off value of 1.0235. Conclusions:There was a strong negative correlation between fractal dimension and midpalatal suture maturation. Fractal analysis is an objective quantitative method, and therefore we suggest that it may be useful for the evaluation of midpalatal suture maturation.","Kyoung Ho Kwak,Seong Sik Kim,Yong-Il Kim,Yong-Deok Kim","Cone-beam computed tomography,Fractal analysis,Midpalatal suture,Rapid palatal expansion."
Evaluation of buccolingual molar inclinations among different vertical facial types.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30206532/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to compare the buccolingual inclination of maxillary and mandibular molars in adults with different vertical facial types. Methods:Cone-beam computed tomography images of 135 adult patients (age, 20-45 years) with skeletal Class I maxillomandibular relationships were assigned to normodivergent (n = 46), hypodivergent (n = 49), and hyperdivergent groups (n = 40) according to linear and angular sella-nasion/gonion-menton measurements.

Comprehensive orthodontic treatment of a young girl with an odontogenic keratocyst and impacted teeth in the mandible.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32042721/,"Odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs) are one of the most aggressive cysts in the oral and maxillofacial area because of their high recurrence rate and infiltrative behavior. In growing patients with OKCs, a radical treatment approach might cause numerous complications, including the disturbance of jaw growth and loss of the involved tooth. This case report describes successful comprehensive orthodontic treatment combined with marsupialization of the cyst in a young girl who exhibited an OKC with impacted teeth. The 10-year-old girl presented with an OKC extending from the mandibular symphysis through the left mandibular body, with ectopic impaction of the mandibular left canine and first premolar, as well as congenitally missing bilateral mandibular second premolars. Interestingly, spontaneous improvement of the positions of the ectopic impacted teeth, along with a reduction in the size of the cyst, occurred during marsupialization. The sequential use of removable and fixed appliances enabled orthodontic traction of the impacted teeth. The treatment outcome was stable at 2.5 years after the end of the treatment. We speculate that comprehensive orthodontic treatment combined with marsupialization can be an effective treatment strategy for patients with OKCs, especially when they are encountered in young, growing patients with impacted teeth.","Won-Kyeong Baik,Hyoung-Seon Baik,Sung-Hwan Choi","Impacted teeth,Marsupialization,Odontogenic keratocyst,Orthodontic traction."

Methods:Twenty-eight subjects were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to either the labial or lingual group.En masseanterior retraction was performed using labial biocreative therapy in group A and lingual biocreative therapy in group B. Cone beam computed tomography scans were taken before and after retraction and the primary outcome was the type of tooth movement during anterior retraction. Data were analyzed using pairedt-tests for comparisons within each group and independent-samplet-test for comparison of the mean treatment changes between the two groups. Results:Significant differences were found between the two groups in relation to the type of tooth movement (labiolingual inclination of the central incisor; mean difference, 5.85 ± 1.85°). The canine showed significant distal tipping in the lingual group (mean difference, 6.98 ± 1.25°). The canine was significantly more intruded in the lingual group (mean difference, 1.67 ± 0.49 mm). Good anchorage control and significant soft tissue changes occurred in both groups. No serious adverse effects were detected. Conclusions:With a 10-mm retraction hook, the labial biocreative technique with the reverse curve overlay provided anterior retraction with good torque control, while in the lingual group, anterior retraction occurred with controlled tipping movement with significant distal tipping and intrusion of the canine (trial registration: The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT03239275]).","Mais M Sadek,Noha E Sabet,Islam T Hassan","Biocreative therapy,En masse retraction,Skeletal anchorage,Tooth movement."
Reliability of cone-beam computed tomography for temporomandibular joint analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30941294/,"Objective:The aim was to assess the intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities of temporomandibular joint linear measurements and condylar shape classifications performed with cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods:CBCT images of 30 patients were measured at two different time points by two orthodontists using the Dolphin 3D program (n = 60). Anterior, posterior, and superior joint space measurements and sagittal joint morphology classification in the sagittal view and medial and lateral joint space and mediolateral width measurements and coronal joint morphology classification in the coronal view were recorded. Intraclass-interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and kappa statistics were used to assess intraobserver and interobserver reliability for the measurements and morphology classifications, respectively. Results:The ICC values were good for measurements of the posterior joint space by observer I and for measurements of the posterior, medial, and lateral joint spaces by observer II, while the other intraobserver measurements were excellent. Only the mediolateral width measurements showed excellent interobserver ICC values, while the other measurements showed good interobserver ICC values. Intraobserver agreement for the sagittal morphology classifications was moderate (κ = 0.479) and almost perfect (κ = 0.858) for observers I and II, respectively, while the corresponding agreement for the coronal morphology classifications was substantial for both observers. The interobserver agreement values for sagittal and coronal morphology classifications were slight (κ = 0.181) and fair (κ = 0.265), respectively. Conclusions:Linear temporomandibular joint measurements were reproducible and reliable in both intraobserver and interobserver evaluations.

Prediction of optimal bending angles of a running loop to achieve bodily protraction of a molar using the finite element method.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29291183/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to predict the optimal bending angles of a running loop for bodily protraction of the mandibular first molars and to clarify the mechanics of molar tipping and rotation. Methods:A three-dimensional finite element model was developed for predicting tooth movement, and a mechanical model based on the beam theory was constructed for clarifying force systems. Results:When a running loop without bends was used, the molar tipped mesially by 9.6° and rotated counterclockwise by 5.4°. These angles were almost similar to those predicted by the beam theory. When the amount of tip-back and toe-in angles were 11.5° and 9.9°, respectively, bodily movement of the molar was achieved. When the bend angles were increased to 14.2° and 18.7°, the molar tipped distally by 4.9° and rotated clockwise by 1.5°. Conclusions:Bodily movement of a mandibular first molar was achieved during protraction by controlling the tip-back and toe-in angles with the use of a running loop. The beam theory was effective for understanding the mechanics of molar tipping and rotation, as well as for predicting the optimal bending angles.","Woon-Kuk Ryu,Jae Hyun Park,Kiyoshi Tai,Yukio Kojima,Youngjoo Lee,Jong-Moon Chae","Finite element method,Molar protraction,Running loop,Tip-back angle."
Three-dimensional surgical accuracy between virtually planned and actual surgical movements of the maxilla in two-jaw orthognathic surgery.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938822/,"Objective:To investigate the three-dimensional (3D) surgical accuracy between virtually planned and actual surgical movements (SM) of the maxilla in twojaw orthognathic surgery. Methods:The sample consisted of 15 skeletal Class III patients who underwent two-jaw orthognathic surgery performed by a single surgeon using a virtual surgical simulation (VSS) software. The 3D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were obtained before (T0) and after surgery (T1). After merging the dental cast image onto the T0 CBCT image, VSS was performed. SM were classified into midline correction (anterior and posterior), advancement, setback, anterior elongation, and impaction (total and posterior). The landmarks were the midpoint between the central incisors, the mesiobuccal cusp tip (MBCT) of both first molars, and the midpoint of the two MBCTs. The amount and direction of SM by VSS and actual surgery were measured using 3D coordinates of the landmarks. Discrepancies less than 1 mm between VSS and T1 landmarks indicated a precise outcome. The surgical achievement percentage (SAP, [amount of movement in actual surgery/ amount of movement in VSS] × 100) (%) and precision percentage (PP, [number of patients with precise outcome/number of total patients] × 100) (%) were compared among SM types using Fisher's exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results:Overall mean discrepancy between VSS and actual surgery, SAP, and PP were 0.13 mm, 89.9%, and 68.3%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the SAP and PP values among the seven SM types (allp> 0.05).

Effect of slow forced eruption on the vertical levels of the interproximal bone and papilla and the width of the alveolar ridge.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27896212/,"Objective:Forced eruption has been proposed for the reconstruction of deficient bone and soft tissue. The aim of this study was to examine the changes in the alveolar ridge width and the vertical levels of the interproximal bone and papilla following forced eruption. Methods:Patients whose hopeless maxillary anterior teeth were expected to undergo severe bone resorption and soft tissue recession upon extraction were recruited. In addition, patients whose maxillary anterior teeth required forced eruption for restoration due to tooth fracture or dental caries were included. Before and after forced eruption, the interproximal bone height was measured by radiographic analysis, and changes in the alveolar ridge width and the interproximal papilla height were measured with an acrylic stent. Results:This prospective study demonstrated that the levels of the interproximal alveolar bone and papilla were significantly increased by 1.36 mm and 1.09 mm, respectively, in the vertical direction. However, the alveolar ridge width was significantly reduced by an average of 0.67 mm in the buccolingual direction. The changes in the level of the interproximal alveolar bone and papilla were positively correlated. Conclusions:Although the levels of the interproximal bone and papilla were significantly increased, the alveolar ridge width was significantly decreased following forced eruption. There was a modest positive and significant correlation between the changes in the height of the interproximal alveolar bone and the papilla. Based on our findings, modification of vertical forced eruption should be considered when augmentation of the alveolar ridge width is required.","Eun-Young Kwon,Ju-Youn Lee,Jeomil Choi","Orthodontic extrusion,Tooth movement."
Comparison of mechanical and biological properties of zirconia and titanium alloy orthodontic micro-implants.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28670564/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to compare the initial stability as insertion and removal torque and the clinical applicability of novel orthodontic zirconia micro-implants made using a powder injection molding (PIM) technique with those parameters in conventional titanium micro-implants. Methods:Sixty zirconia and 60 titanium micro-implants of similar design (diameter, 1.6 mm; length, 8.0 mm) were inserted perpendicularly in solid polyurethane foam with varying densities of 20 pounds per cubic foot (pcf), 30 pcf, and 40 pcf. Primary stability was measured as maximum insertion torque (MIT) and maximum removal torque (MRT). To investigate clinical applicability, compressive and tensile forces were recorded at 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 mm displacement of the implants at angles of 0°, 10°, 20°, 30°, and 40°. The biocompatibility of zirconia micro-implants was assessed via an experimental animal study. Results:There were no statistically significant differences between zirconia micro-implants and titanium alloy implants with regard to MIT, MRT, or the amount of movement in the angulated lateral displacement test. As angulation increased, the mean compressive and tensile forces required to displace both types of micro-implants increased substantially at all distances. The average bone-to-implant contact ratio of prototype zirconia micro-implants was 56.88 ± 6.72%.

Use of autonomous maximal smile to evaluate dental and gingival exposure.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29732304/,"Objective:This study was performed to validate the autonomous maximal smile (AMS) as a new reference for evaluating dental and gingival exposure. Methods:Digital video clips of 100 volunteers showing posed smiles and AMS at different verbal directives were recorded for evaluation a total of three times at 1-week intervals. Lip-teeth relationship width (LTRW) and buccal corridor width (BCW) were measured. LTRW represented the vertical distance between the inferior border of the upper vermilion and the edge of the maxillary central incisors. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for reproducibility, and the m-value (minimum number of repeated measurements required for an ICC level over 0.75), were calculated. Results:LTRW and BCW of the AMS were 1.41 and 2.04 mm, respectively, greater than those of the posed smile (p< 0.05), indicating significantly larger dental and gingival exposure in the AMS. The reproducibility of the AMS (0.74 to 0.77) was excellent, and higher than that of the posed smile (0.62 to 0.65), which had fair-to-good reproducibility. Moreover, the m-value of the AMS (0.88 to 1.05) was lower than that of the posed smile (1.59 to 1.85). Conclusions:Compared to the posed smile, the AMS shows significantly larger LTRW and BCW, with significantly higher reproducibility.

Evaluation of cephalometric characteristics and skeletal maturation of the cervical vertebrae and hand-wrist in girls with central precocious puberty.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32475845/,"Objective:This study aimed to evaluate the differences in cephalometric characteristics and skeletal maturation in girls with central precocious puberty (CPP) via lateral and hand-wrist radiographs. We also aimed to identify the indicators that are most effective for determining skeletal maturity in these patients. Methods:The study included 70 Korean girls (mean age, 8.5 ± 0.5 years) diagnosed with CPP at the Department of Pediatrics, and 48 normal healthy age-matched girls who visited the Department of Orthodontics and had no history of hormone treatment or growth problems. Skeletal maturation was evaluated using lateral cephalometric and hand-wrist radiographs using cervical vertebrae maturation indicators (CVMI) and skeletal maturity indicators (SMI). Results:The mean mandibular plane angle was smaller in the CPP group than in the control group (35.8° ± 4.9° vs. 39.0° ± 6.5°), resulting in greater posterior facial height (p= 0.003). SMI was significantly greater in the CPP group (3.5 ± 1.4 vs. 2.0 ± 1.0) than in the control group (p= 0.001) and was significantly associated with CPP (r= 0.492;p= 0.001), whereas CVMI was not. Conclusions:In comparison with the control group, the CPP group exhibited a smaller mandibular plane angle, greater posterior facial height, and greater skeletal maturation. SMI may be more suitable than CVMI for determining skeletal maturation in CPP.

"The relationships between the arrangement of teeth, root resorption, and dental maturity in bovine mandibular incisors.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29090124/,"Objective:The objective of this study is to investigate the eruption pattern and root resorption of the bovine anterior dentition in relation to growth-related parameters based on dental maturity. Methods:A cross-sectional study was conducted on 110 bovine anterior mandibles by using standard radiography, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), and actual measurements. We determined the relationships between the stages of dental maturity by using a modification of Demirjian's method and various growth-related parameters, such as the activity of the root-resorbing tissue and mobility of the deciduous teeth. The correlation of growth-related parameters with interdental spacing and distal unusual root resorption (DRR) of the deciduous fourth incisor was assessed. The cause of mesial unusual root resorption (MRR) of the deciduous fourth incisor was determined on the basis of the arrangement of the permanent third incisor. Results:An independentt-test and chi-square test indicated significant differences in growth-related parameters associated with dental arch length discrepancy and factors related to the shedding of deciduous teeth between the low and high dental maturity groups. The samples with interdental spacing and DRR showed a larger sum of mesiodistal permanent crown widths and higher dental maturity than did the respective controls. Samples with MRR tended to show a lingually rotated distal tip of the adjacent tooth crown. Conclusions:Dental maturity has relevance to the interdental spaces and unusual root resorption of mixed dentition. The position of the adjacent tooth crown on CBCT may be correlated with the occurrence of unusual root resorption of the incisor.","Jin-Kyu An,Yoshiro Matsumoto,Takashi Ono","Computed tomography,Ectopic eruption,Growth and development,Root resorption."

Methods:Five examiners identified 16 landmarks (Cg, N, ANS, GT, Me, RO, Lo, FM, Z, Or, Zyg, Cd, NC, Ms, M, and Ag) on 32 PA cephalograms with and without LA cephalograms at the same time. The positions of the landmarks were recorded and saved in the horizontal and vertical direction. The mean errors and standard deviation of landmarks location according to the use of LA cephalograms were compared for each landmark. Results:Relatively small errors were found for ANS, Me, Ms, and Ag, while relatively large errors were found for N, GT, Z, Or, and Cd. No significant difference was found between the horizontal and vertical errors for Z and Or, while large vertical errors were found for N, GT, and Cd. The value of identification error was lower when the landmarks were identified using LA cephalograms. Statistically significant error reductions were found at N and Cd with LA cephalograms, especially in the vertical direction.

Longitudinal management of recurrent temporomandibular joint ankylosis from infancy to adulthood in perspective of surgical and orthodontic treatment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31815109/,"This study was performed to describe the longitudinal management of recurrent temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis from infancy to adulthood in perspective of surgical and orthodontic treatment. A 2-year-old girl was referred with chief complaints of restricted mouth opening and micrognathia due to bilateral TMJ ankylosis. For stage I treatment during early childhood (6 years old), high condylectomy and interpositional arthroplasty were performed. However, TMJ ankylosis recurred and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) developed. For stage II treatment during early adolescence (12 years old), gap arthroplasty, coronoidectomy, bilateral mandibular distraction osteogenesis, and orthodontic treatment with extraction of the four first premolars were performed. However, TMJ ankylosis recurred. Because the OSA symptoms reappeared, she began to use a continuous positive airway pressure device. For stage III treatment after completion of growth (20 years old), low condylectomy, coronoidectomy, reconstruction of the bilateral TMJs with artificial prostheses along with counterclockwise rotational advancement of the mandible, genioglossus advancement, and orthodontic treatment were performed. After stage III treatment, the amount of mouth opening exhibited a significant increase. Mandibular advancement and ramus lengthening resulted in significant improvement in the facial profile, Class I relationships, and normal overbite/overjet. The OSA symptoms were also relieved. These outcomes were stable at the one-year follow-up visit. Since the treatment modalities for TMJ ankylosis differ according to the duration of ankylosis, patient age, and degree of deformity, the treatment flowchart suggested in this report could be used as an effective guideline for determining the appropriate timing and methods for the treatment of TMJ ankylosis.","Seung-Weon Lim,Jin-Young Choi,Seung-Hak Baek","Artificial prosthesis,Distraction osteogenesis,Reconstruction,Temporomandibular joint ankylosis."

Facial photographs of frontal posed smiles and lateral cephalograms of the subjects were taken. The subjects were divided into 3 groups on the basis of UIERs and 20 measurements were compared among the 3 groups. The correlations between the variables were determined. Results:Male and female subjects showed significant differences in the group distribution. Male subjects showed higher frequencies of low smiles, and female subjects showed higher frequencies of high smiles. The vertical height of the anterior alveolar process of the maxilla directly correlated with the UIER. However, the UIER showed no significant correlation with the vertical height of the anterior basal bone or the inclination of the upper incisor axis. In female subjects, the upper central incisor clinical crown length showed an inverse correlation with the UIER. However, this variable showed no significant correlation with the UIER in male subjects.

Results:The Me and GT landmarks showed excellent reliability (ICC ≥ 0.993) three-dimensionally. In the transverse evaluation, the ICC values of the GT (range, 0.997-0.999) tended to be slightly higher than those of Me (range, 0.993-0.996). In the Bland-Altman plots for the two separate assessments, Me showed a maximum error of 1.76 mm in the transverse direction, whereas the GT showed a maximum error of 0.96 mm in the 95% limit. Conclusions:Our results suggest that both Me and GT are clinically reliable and equally useful landmarks for the evaluation of mandibular asymmetry on CBCT images.","Seung-Youp Lee,Dong-Soon Choi,Insan Jang,Geun-Su Song,Bong-Kuen Cha","Cone-beam computed tomography,Genial tubercle,Menton,Three-dimensional cephalometrics."
Effectiveness of caries-preventing agents on initial carious lesions within the scope of orthodontic therapy.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31367579/,"Objective:To evaluate the effectiveness of three different caries-preventing agents on artificial caries in aStreptococcus mutans-based caries model. Methods:Sixty-five caries-free human molar enamel blocks were treated with a demineralization solution and a remineralization solution. The specimens were assigned to the following groups according to the caries-protective product applied: group A, chlorhexidine varnish; group B, fluoride-releasing chemically cured sealant; group C, fluoride-releasing lightcured sealant; group D, positive control (specimens that were subjected to de- and remineralization cycles without treatment with any caries-protective agents); and group E, negative control (specimens that were not subjected to de- and remineralization cycles). Samples in groups A-D were stored in demineralization solution withS. mutansand thereafter in artificial saliva. This procedure was performed for 30 days. Average fluorescence loss (ΔF) and surface size of the lesions were measured using quantitative light-induced fluorescence at baseline and on the 7th, 14th, and 30th days. Results:After 30 days, group A demonstrated a significant increase in ΔF and the surface size of the lesions, no significant difference in comparison with the positive control group, and a significant difference in comparison with the negative control group. Group B showed no significant changes in both parameters at any of the measurement points. While group C showed increased ΔF after 14 days, no significant fluorescence change was observed after 30 days. Conclusions:Both fluoride-releasing sealants (chemically or light-cured) show anti-cariogenic effects, but the use of chlorhexidine varnish for the purpose of caries protection needs to be reconsidered.","Kyung-Jin Park,Tessa Kroker,Uwe Groß,Ortrud Zimmermann,Felix Krause,Rainer Haak,Dirk Ziebolz","Cervitec Plus,Maximum Cure,Pro Seal,Quantitative light-induced fluorescence."
Cephalometric predictors of treatment outcome with mandibular advancement devices in adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea: a systematic review.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26629477/,"Objective:The efficacy of mandibular advancement devices (MADs) in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) ranges between 42% and 65%. However, it is still unclear which predictive factors can be used to select suitable patients for MAD treatment. This study aimed to systematically review the literature on the predictive value of cephalometric analysis for MAD treatment outcomes in adult OSA patients. Methods:The MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched through December 2014. Reference lists from the retrieved publications were also examined. English language studies published in international peer-reviewed journals concerning the predictive value of cephalometric analysis for MAD treatment outcome were considered for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data, and ascertained the quality of the studies. Results:Fifteen eligible studies were identified. Most of the skeletal, dental, and soft tissue cephalometric measurements examined were widely recognized as not prognostic for MAD treatment outcome; however, controversial and limited data were found on the predictive role of certain cephalometric measurements including cranial base angle, mandibular plane angle, hyoid to mandibular plane distance, posterior nasal spine to soft-palate tip distance, anterior nasal spine to epiglottis base distance, and tongue/oral cross sectional area ratio thus justifying additional studies on these parameters. Conclusions:Currently available evidence is inadequate for identification of cephalometric parameters capable of reliably discriminating between poor and good responders to MAD treatment. To guide further research, methodological weaknesses of the currently available studies were highlighted and possible reasons for their discordant results were analyzed.","Giulio Alessandri-Bonetti,Daniela Rita Ippolito,Maria Lavinia Bartolucci,Vincenzo D'Antò,Serena Incerti-Parenti","Mandibular advancement,Obstructive sleep apnea, Cephalometry."
Effects of thermoforming on the physical and mechanical properties of thermoplastic materials for transparent orthodontic aligners.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30206530/,"Objective:The aim of this systematic multiscale analysis was to evaluate the effects of thermoforming on the physical and mechanical properties of thermoplastic materials used to fabricate transparent orthodontic aligners (TOAs). Methods:Specimens were fabricated using four types of thermoplastic materials with different thicknesses under a thermal vacuum. Transparency, water absorption and solubility, surface hardness, and the results of three-point bending and tensile tests were evaluated before and after thermoforming. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Student'st-test. Results:After thermoforming, the transparency of Duran and Essix A+ decreased, while the water absorption ability of all materials; the water solubility of Duran, Essix A+, and Essix ACE; and the surface hardness of Duran and Essix A+ increased. The flexure modulus for the 0.5-mm-thick Duran, Essix A+, and eCligner specimens increased, whereas that for the 0.75-/1.0-mm-thick Duran and eClginer specimens decreased. In addition, the elastic modulus increased for the 0.5-mm-thick Essix A+ specimens and decreased for the 0.75-mm-thick Duran and Essix ACE and the 1.0-mm-thick Essix ACE specimens. Conclusions:Our findings suggest that the physical and mechanical properties of thermoplastic materials used for the fabrication of TOAs should be evaluated after thermoforming in order to characterize their properties for clinical application.","Jeong-Hyun Ryu,Jae-Sung Kwon,Heng Bo Jiang,Jung-Yul Cha,Kwang-Mahn Kim","Aligner,Mechanical properties,Physical properties,Thermoplastic materials."
Treatment effects of mandibular total arch distalization using a ramal plate.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27478798/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate treatment effects after distalization of the mandibular dentition using ramal plates through lateral cephalograms. Methods:Pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalograms and dental casts of 22 adult patients (11 males and 11 females; mean age, 23.9 ± 5.52 years) who received ramal plates for mandibular molar distalization were analyzed. The treatment effects and amount of distalization of the mandibular molars were calculated and tested for statistical significance. The significance level was set at p < 0.001. Results:The mandibular first molar distalization at the crown and root were 2.10 mm (p < 0.001) and 0.81 mm (p = 0.011), respectively. In the evaluation of skeletal variables, there was a significant increase in the Wits appraisal (p < 0.001). In the evaluation of the soft tissue, there was no significant effect on upper lip position, but the lower lips showed a significant retraction of 2.2 mm (p < 0.001). Conclusions:The mandibular molars showed a significant amount of distalization accompanied by limited extrusion and mesiobuccal rotation of the crowns.

Methods:Ninety adults who had malocclusion and had records of facial skeletal measurements performed using cone-beam computed tomography were selected for this study. The skeletal measurements were classified into three groups (vertical, anteroposterior, and transverse). Cross-sectional images of the mandibular symphysis were analyzed using generalized Procrustes and principal component (PC) analyses. A SEM was constructed after the factors were extracted via factor analysis. Results:Two factors were extracted from the transverse, vertical, and anteroposterior skeletal measurements. Latent variables were extracted for each factor. PC1, PC2, and PC3 were selected to analyze the variations of the mandibular symphyseal shape. The SEM was constructed using the skeletal variables, PCs, and latent variables. The SEM showed that the vertical latent variable exerted the most influence on the mandibular symphyseal shape. Conclusions:The relationship between the skeletal pattern and the mandibular symphysis was analyzed using a SEM, which showed that the vertical facial skeletal pattern had the highest effect on the shape of the mandibular symphysis.","Mi So Ahn,Sang Min Shin,Tetsutaro Yamaguchi,Koutaro Maki,Te-Ju Wu,Ching-Chang Ko,Yong-Il Kim","Facial skeletal pattern,Morphology of mandibular symphysis,Structural equation model."
Stability of bimaxillary surgery involving intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy with or without presurgical miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion in adult patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938823/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the stability of bimaxillary surgery involving bilateral intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy performed with or without presurgical miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion (MARPE) in adult patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion. Methods:A total of 40 adult patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion were retrospectively divided into two groups (n = 20 each) according to the use of MARPE for the correction of transverse maxillomandibular discrepancy during presurgical orthodontic treatment. Serial lateral cephalograms and dental casts were analyzed until 6 months after surgery. Results:Before presurgical orthodontic treatment, there was no significant differences in terms of sex and age between groups. However, the difference of approximately 3.1 mm in the maxillomandibular intermolar width was statistically significant (p< 0.001). Two days after surgery, the mandible had moved backward and upward without any significant intergroup difference. Six months after surgery, the maxillary intercanine (2.7 ± 2.1 mm), interpremolar (3.6 ± 2.4 mm), and intermolar (2.0 ± 1.3 mm) arch widths were significantly increased (p< 0.001) relative to the values before presurgical orthodontic treatment in the MARPE group; these widths were maintained or decreased in the control group. However, there was no significant difference in surgical changes and the postsurgical stability between the two groups. No significant correlations existed between the amount of maxillary expansion and postsurgical mandibular movement. Conclusions:MARPE is useful for stable and nonsurgical expansion of the maxilla in adult patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion who are scheduled for bimaxillary surgery.","Yoon-Soo Ahn,Sung-Hwan Choi,Kee-Joon Lee,Young-Soo Jung,Hyoung-Seon Baik,Hyung-Seog Yu","Miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion,Skeletal Class III malocclusion,Stability,Transverse maxillomandibular discrepancy."
Comparison of treatment effects between four premolar extraction and total arch distalization using the modified C-palatal plate.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30003056/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to compare the skeletal, dental, and soft-tissue treatment effects of nonextraction therapy using the modified C-palatal plate (MCPP) to those of premolar extraction (PE) treatment in adult patients with Class II malocclusion. Methods:Pretreatment and posttreatment lateral cephalographs of 40 adult patients with Class II malocclusion were retrospectively analyzed. The MCPP group comprised 20 patients treated with total arch distalization of the maxillary arch while the PE group comprised 20 patients treated with four PE. Fifty-eight linear and angular measurements were analyzed to assess the changes before and after treatment. Descriptive statistics, pairedt-test, and multivariate analysis of variance were performed to evaluate the treatment effects within and between the two groups. Results:The MCPP group presented 3.4 mm of retraction, 1.0 mm of extrusion, and 7.3° lingual inclination of the maxillary central incisor. In comparison, the PE group displayed greater amount of maxillary central incisor retraction and retroclination, mandibular incisor retraction, and upper lip retraction (5.3 mm, 14.8°, 5.1 mm, and 2.0 mm, respectively;p< 0.001 for all). In addition, the MCPP group showed 4.0 mm of distalization and 1.3 mm of intrusion with 2.9° distal tipping of the maxillary first molars. Conclusions:These findings suggest the MCPP is an effective distalization appliance in the maxillary arch. The amount of incisor retraction, however, was significantly higher in the PE group. Therefore, four PE may be recommended when greater improvement of incisor position and soft-tissue profile is required.","Sung Youn Jo,Mohamed Bayome,Justyn Park,Hee Jin Lim,Yoon-Ah Kook,Seong Ho Han","Adult treatment,Extraction vs. nonextraction,Modified C-palatal plate,Orthodontic implant."
The effect of occlusogingival placement of clinical bracket points on the adaptation of a straight wire to the lingual arch form.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30003057/,"Objective:The aim of this study is to compare the adaptation of a straight wire between brackets positioned at the mid-lingual surface and those placed gingivally by using a three-dimensional simulation software. Methods:This cross-sectional study was performed using OrthoAid, an in-house software. The subjects were 36 adolescents with normal Class I occlusion. For each dental cast, two bracket positioning approaches, namely the middle and gingival, were examined. In the middle group, the reference points were placed on the mid-lingual surface of each tooth, while in the gingival group, the reference points were positioned lingually on the anterior teeth. A 4th degree polynomial was adopted, and the in-plane and off-plane root mean squares (RMSs) of the distances between the reference points and the fitted polynomial curve were calculated using the software. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired-samplest-test (α = 0.05). Results:The mean in-plane RMS of the polynomial curve to the bracket distance in the gingival group was significantly lower than that in the middle group (p< 0.001). The off-plane RMS was higher in the gingivally positioned brackets in the maxilla than in the middle group (p< 0.001). However, the off-plane RMS in mandible was not statistically significantly different between the two groups (p= 0.274). Conclusions:The results demonstrated that the gingival placement of lingual brackets on the anterior teeth could decrease the distance between a tooth and the straight wire.","Amir Hossein Abdi,Saeed Reza Motamedian,Ehsan Balaghi,Mahtab Nouri","Lingual orthodontics,Orthodontic brackets,Orthodontics,Tooth movement techniques."
The Improvement and Completion of Outcome index: A new assessment system for quality of orthodontic treatment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27478797/,"Objective:Given the considerable disagreement between the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) index and the American Board of Orthodontics Cast-Radiograph Evaluation, we aimed to develop a novel assessment system-the Improvement and Completion of Outcome (ICO) index-to evaluate the outcome of orthodontic treatment. Methods:Sixteen criteria from 4 major categories were established to represent the pretreatment malocclusion status, as well as the degree of improvement and level of completion of outcome during/after treatment: dental relationship (arch length discrepancy, irregularity, U1-SN, and IMPA); anteroposterior relationship (overjet, right and left molar position, ANB); vertical relationship (anterior overbite, anterior open-bite, lateral open-bite, SN-MP); and transverse relationship (dental midline discrepancy, chin point deviation, posterior cross-bite, occlusal plane cant). The score for each criterion was defined from 0 or -1 (worst) to 5 (ideal value or normal occlusion) in gradations of 1. The sum of the scores in each category indicates the area and extent of the problems. Improvement and completion percentages were estimated based on the pre- and post-treatment total scores and the maximum total score. If the completion percentage exceeded 80%, treatment outcome was considered successful. Results:Two cases, Class I malocclusion and skeletal Class III malocclusion, are presented to represent the assessment procedure using the ICO index. The difference in the level of improvement and completion of treatment outcome can be clearly explained by using 2 percentage values.

Patterns of medical accidents and disputes in the orthodontic field in Korea.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24511510/,"The committee of admitted doctors developed a questionnaire regarding medical dispute and distributed it to 1,600 members of Korean Academy of Orthodontics. The questionnaire consisted of three categories and 56 items covering basic information about the doctors and patients who had experienced medical disputes, the cause and workaround of medical accidents, and methods for taking precautions. The present survey showed a similar proportion of responders who had experienced a medical accident compared to the study in 1997. The primary reason for medical disputes was dissatisfaction with appearance. Many doctors felt that they would likely experience a medical dispute at some point. Most disputes were settled by doctors themselves, usually for an amount of less than 5 million Korean won. For some doctors, medical accidents lead to ongoing psychological problems. Responders felt that continuing education for medical dispute is very necessary. These results reveal a need for the association of orthodontists to lead advancements in education and countermeasures for preventing and managing medical accidents and disputes.","Young Hoon Kim,Chung Ju Hwang","Ethics,Legal issue,Medical mistake,Practice management,Risk management,Socioeconomic factors."
Incorporation of silver nanoparticles on the surface of orthodontic microimplants to achieve antimicrobial properties.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28127534/,"Objective:Microbial aggregation around dental implants can lead to loss/loosening of the implants. This study was aimed at surface treating titanium microimplants with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to achieve antibacterial properties. Methods:AgNP-modified titanium microimplants (Ti-nAg) were prepared using two methods. The first method involved coating the microimplants with regular AgNPs (Ti-AgNP) and the second involved coating them with a AgNP-coated biopolymer (Ti-BP-AgNP). The topologies, microstructures, and chemical compositions of the surfaces of the Ti-nAg were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Disk diffusion tests usingStreptococcus mutans,Streptococcus sanguinis, andAggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitanswere performed to test the antibacterial activity of the Ti-nAg microimplants. Results:SEM revealed that only a meager amount of AgNPs was sparsely deposited on the Ti-AgNP surface with the first method, while a layer of AgNP-coated biopolymer extended along the Ti-BP-AgNP surface in the second method. The diameters of the coated nanoparticles were in the range of 10 to 30 nm. EDS revealed 1.05 atomic % of Ag on the surface of the Ti-AgNP and an astounding 21.2 atomic % on the surface of the Ti-BP-AgNP. XPS confirmed the metallic state of silver on the Ti-BP-AgNP surface. After 24 hours of incubation, clear zones of inhibition were seen around the Ti-BP-AgNP microimplants in all three test bacterial culture plates, whereas no antibacterial effect was observed with the Ti-AgNP microimplants.

Evaluation of factors influencing the success rate of orthodontic microimplants using panoramic radiographs.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29291186/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to investigate factors influencing the success rate of orthodontic microimplants (OMIs) using panoramic radiographs (PRs). Methods:We examined 160 OMIs inserted bilaterally in the maxillary buccal alveolar bone between the second premolars and first molars of 80 patients (51 women, 29 men; mean age, 18.0 ± 6.1 years) undergoing treatment for malocclusion. The angulation and position of OMIs, as well as other parameters, were measured on PRs. The correlation between each measurement and the OMI success rate was then evaluated. Results:The overall success rate was 85.0% (136/160). Age was found to be a significant predictor of implant success (p< 0.05), while sex, side of placement, extraction, and position of the OMI tip were not significant predictors (p> 0.05). The highest success rate was observed for OMIs with tips positioned on the interradicular midline (IRML; central position). Univariate analyses revealed that the OMI success rate significantly increased with an increase in the OMI length and placement height of OMI (p= 0.001). However, in simultaneous analyses, only length remained significant (p= 0.027).

Bone cutting capacity and osseointegration of surface-treated orthodontic mini-implants.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27896213/,"Objective:The objective of the study was to evaluate the practicality and the validity of different surface treatments of self-drilling orthodontic mini-implants (OMIs) by comparing bone cutting capacity and osseointegration. Methods:Self-drilling OMIs were surface-treated in three ways: Acid etched (Etched), resorbable blasting media (RBM), partially resorbabla balsting media (Hybrid). We compared the bone cutting capacity by measuring insertion depths into artificial bone (polyurethane foam). To compare osseointegration, OMIs were placed in the tibia of 25 rabbits and the removal torque value was measured at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after placement. The specimens were analyzed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Results:The bone cutting capacity of the etched and hybrid group was lower than the machined (control) group, and was most inhibited in the RBM group (p< 0.05). At 4 weeks, the removal torque in the machined group was significantly decreased (p< 0.05), but was increased in the etched group (p< 0.05). In the hybrid group, the removal torque significantly increased at 2 weeks, and was the highest among all measured values at 8 weeks (p< 0.05). The infiltration of bone-like tissue surface was evaluated by SEM, and calcium and phosphorus were detected via EDS only in the hybrid group. Conclusions:Partial RBM surface treatment (hybrid type in this study) produced the most stable self-drilling OMIs, without a corresponding reduction in bone cutting capacity.","Ho-Young Kim,Sang-Cheol Kim","Bone cutting capacity,Orthodontic mini-implant,Osseointegration,Surface treatment."

The open-circuit potential and potentiodynamic polarization of these materials were measured. Thereafter, all samples were evaluated under a field-emission scanning electron microscope. Results:Among the tested oral rinses, except solution D, the more the fluoride content was, the greater was the corrosion potential downtrend; the corrosion resistance of the titanium alloy sample was also lowered significantly (p< 0.05). Field-emission scanning electron microscopic analysis of the surface morphology of the titanium alloy samples revealed that all samples had some defects, crevices, or pitting after exposure to the oral rinses than before treatment. In particular, the samples in solution A showed the most changes.

Growth observation and orthodontic treatment of a hemifacial microsomia patient treated with distraction osteogenesis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32257939/,"Hemifacial microsomia (HFM) patients may experience emotional withdrawal during their growth period due to their abnormal facial appearance. Distraction osteogenesis at an early age to improve their appearance can encourage these patients. Some abnormalities of the affected side can be overcome by distraction osteogenesis at an early age. However, differences in the growth rate between the affected and unaffected sides during the rest of the growth period are inevitable due to the characteristics of HFM. Therefore, re-evaluation should be performed after completion of growth in order to achieve stable occlusion through either orthognathic surgery or camouflage orthodontic treatment. An eight-year-old patient visited the clinic exhibiting features of HFM with slight mandibular involvement. He received phase I treatment with distraction osteogenesis and a functional appliance. Distraction osteogenesis was performed at the right ramus, which resulted in an open bite at the right posterior dentition. After distraction osteogenesis, a functional appliance and partial fixed appliance were used to achieve extrusion of the affected posterior dentition and settlement of the occlusion adjustment on the unaffected posterior dentition. The patient visited the clinic regularly for follow-up assessments, and at the age of 20 years, he showed facial asymmetry of the mandible, which had deviated to the right side. He received orthodontic treatment to improve the occlusion of his posterior dentition after the growth period. Without orthognathic surgery, stable occlusion and a satisfactory facial appearance were obtained through camouflage orthodontic treatment.","Nam Hyung Chung,So Jin Yang,Jae Yoen Kang,Young-Mi Jeon,Jong Ghee Kim","Distraction osteogenesis,Hemifacial microsomia."

Methods:In this retrospective study, 38 subjects with functional Class III malocclusion and two lateral cephalograms were selected. The first lateral cephalogram was taken with the mandible in the habitual occlusal position, and the second in anterior edge-to-edge bite. Pairedt-test was used to analyze changes in the PAS, hyoid bone, tongue, and soft palate, followed by mandibular posterior displacement. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between the amount of mandibular posterior displacement and other variables. Results:A statistically significant decrease was observed in the PAS following mandibular posterior displacement. Along with mandibular posterior displacement, the tongue decreased in length (p< 0.001) and increased in height (p< 0.05), while the soft palate increased in length, decreased in thickness, and was posteriorly displaced (p< 0.001). The hyoid bone was also posteriorly displaced (p< 0.05). There was no correlation between the amount of mandibular posterior displacement and the measured variables. Conclusions:The PAS showed a statistically significant decrease following mandibular posterior displacement, which was a consequence of retraction of the surrounding structures.

Methods:Fourteen dry cadaveric mandibles and six teeth extracted from patients with severe periodontitis were used to establish 14 orthodontic tooth-movement models. The protocol consisted of two steps: in the first step, voxel-based CBCT mandible superimposition was performed; the reference comprised the external portion of the symphysis, extending to the first molar. The laser-scanned dental model image was then integrated with the CBCT image to achieve mandibular dental model superimposition. The entire process required approximately 10 minutes. Six landmarks were assigned to the teeth to measure tooth displacement, using tooth displacement on the superimposed laser-scanned mandibles as the reference standard. Accuracy was evaluated by comparing differences in tooth displacement based on the method and the reference standard. Two observers performed superimposition to evaluate reliability. Results:For three-dimensional tooth displacements, the differences between the method and the reference standard were not significant in the molar, premolar, or incisor groups (p> 0.05). The intraclass correlation coefficients for the inter- and intra-observer reliabilities of all measurements were > 0.92. Conclusions:Our method of mandibular dental model superimposition based on voxel registration is accurate, reliable, and can be performed within a reasonable period of timein vitro, demonstrating a potential for use in orthodontic patients.","Gaofeng Han,Jing Li,Shuo Wang,Yan Liu,Xuedong Wang,Yanheng Zhou","Computed tomography,Digital models,Orthodontic treatment,Tooth movement."
Cone-beam computed tomography-guided three-dimensional evaluation of treatment effectiveness of the Frog appliance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31149606/,"Objective:To evaluate the effectiveness of the Frog appliance in three dimensions by using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. Methods:Forty patients (21 boys and 19 girls), averaged 11.7 years old, with an Angle Class II division 1 malocclusion were included in our study. They had either late mixed dentition or early permanent dentition, and the maxillary second molars had not yet erupted. All patients underwent CBCT before and after the treatment for measuring changes in the maxillary first molars, second premolars, central incisors, and profile. Paired-samplest-test was used to compare the mean difference in each variable before treatment and after the first phase of treatment. Results:The maxillary first molars were effectively distalized by 4.25 mm (p< 0.001) and 3.53 mm (p< 0.05) in the dental crown and root apex, respectively. The tipping increased by 2.25°, but the difference was not significant. Moreover the teeth moved buccally by 0.84 mm (p< 0.05) and 2.87 mm (p< 0.01) in the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps, respectively, whereas no significant changes occurred in the root apex. Regarding the anchorage parts, the angle of the maxillary central incisor's long axis to the sella-nasion plane increased by 2.76° (p< 0.05) and the distance from the upper lip to the esthetic plane decreased by 0.52 mm (p= 0.01). Conclusions:The Frog appliance effectively distalized the maxillary molars with an acceptable degree of tipping, distobuccal rotation, and buccal crown torque, with only slight anchorage loss. Furthermore, CBCT image demonstrated that it is a simple and reliable method for three-dimensional analysis.","Mujia Li,Xiaoxia Su,Yang Li,Xianglin Li,Xinqin Si","Class II malocclusion,Cone-beam computed tomography,Molar distalization,Non-extraction treatment."
Preparation and antimicrobial assay of ceramic brackets coated with TiO2 thin films.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27226960/,"Objective:Different methods have been utilized to prevent enamel demineralization and other complications during orthodontic treatment. However, none of these methods can offer long-lasting and effective prevention of orthodontic complications or interventions after complications occur. Considering the photocatalytic effect of TiO2 on organic compounds, we hoped to synthesize a novel bracket with a TiO2 thin film to develop a photocatalytic antimicrobial effect. Methods:The sol-gel dip coating method was used to prepare TiO2 thin films on ceramic bracket surfaces. Twenty groups of samples were composed according to the experimental parameters. Crystalline structure and surface morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, respectively; film thickness was examined with a surface ellipsometer. The photocatalytic properties under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation were analyzed by evaluating the degradation ratio of methylene blue (MB) at a certain time. Antibacterial activities of selected thin films were also tested against Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. Results:Films with 5 coating layers annealed at 700℃ showed the greatest photocatalytic activity in terms of MB decomposition under UV light irradiation. TiO2 thin films with 5 coating layers annealed at 700℃ exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity under UV-A light irradiation. Conclusions:These results provide promising guidance in prevention of demineralization by increasing antimicrobial activities of film coated brackets.","Shuai Cao,Ye Wang,Lin Cao,Yu Wang,Bingpeng Lin,Wei Lan,Baocheng Cao","Antibacterial,Biomaterial science,Ceramic brackets,Esthetics."

Effect of archwire stiffness and friction on maxillary posterior segment displacement during anterior segment retraction: A three-dimensional finite element analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31815107/,"Objective:Sliding mechanics using orthodontic miniscrews is widely used to stabilize the anchorage during extraction space closure. However, previous studies have reported that both posterior segment displacement and anterior segment displacement are possible, depending on the mechanical properties of the archwire. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of archwire stiffness and friction change on the displacement pattern of the maxillary posterior segment during anterior segment retraction with orthodontic miniscrews in sliding mechanics. Methods:A three-dimensional finite element model was constructed. The retraction point was set at the archwire level between the lateral incisor and canine, and the orthodontic miniscrew was located at a height of 8 mm from the archwire between the second premolar and first molar. Archwire stiffness was simulated with rectangular stainless steel wires and a rigid body was used as a control. Various friction levels were set for the surface contact model. Displacement patterns for the posterior and anterior segments were compared between the conditions. Results:Both the anterior and posterior segments exhibited backward rotation, regardless of archwire stiffness or friction. Among the conditions tested in this study, the least undesirable rotation was found with low archwire stiffness and low friction. Conclusions:Posterior segment displacement may be unavoidable but reducing the stiffness and friction of the main archwire may minimize unwanted rotations during extraction space closure.","Choon-Soo Park,Hyung-Seog Yu,Jung-Yul Cha,Sung-Seo Mo,Kee-Joon Lee","Archwire stiffness,Finite element method,Friction,Orthodontic miniscrews."

Methods:A split-mouth randomized controlled trial experiment was designed. Thirty-two adult, male Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups: healing extraction socket (H) and recent extraction socket (R); these groups were randomly classified into 4 subgroups (0/7/21/60 days). The first maxillary molar was extracted on 1 side and 2 months were allowed for complete bone healing; then, the corresponding molar was extracted on the other side and surgical intervention was performed at the mid-alveolar point of the first maxillary molar. Ten grams of continuous force was applied. The outcomes measured were rate of tooth movement, percentage of periodontal space and histological evaluation. The rate of tooth movement was calculated as the measured distance divided by the duration of molar movement. Histomorphometric evaluations were performed on the second and third maxillary molars. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare differences between the two groups. Results:There were no significant differences in the rates of tooth movement between H and R groups at any of the 4 time points. The histological appearance and percentage of periodontal space between the R and H groups also demonstrated no significant differences. Conclusions:The rates of orthodontic tooth movement into recent and healed socket sites did not differ between the groups.

Effects of prestretch on stress relaxation and permanent deformation of orthodontic synthetic elastomeric chains.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30450331/,"Objective:This study was performed to investigate an appropriate degree of prestretch for orthodontic synthetic elastomeric chains focusing on time-dependent viscoelastic properties. Methods:Orthodontic synthetic elastomeric chains of two brands were prestretched to 50, 100, 150, and 200% of the original length in one and three cycles, and the hysteresis areas of the obtained stress-strain curves were determined. Acrylic plates were employed to maintain constant strain during the experiment. A total of 180 samples were classified into nine groups according to brand, and their stresses and permanent deformations were measured immediately after prestretch (0 hour), after 1 hour and 24 hours, and after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks. The relationship between stress relaxation and permanent deformation was investigated for various degrees of prestretch, and the estimated stress resulting from tooth movement was calculated. Results:The degree of prestretch and the stress relaxation ratio exhibited a strong negative correlation, whereas no correlation was found between the degree of prestretch and the average normalized permanent strain. The maximal estimated stress was observed when prestretch was performed in three cycles to 200% of the original length. Conclusions:Although prestretch benefited residual stress, it did not exhibit negative effects such as permanent deformation. The maximal estimated stress was observed at the maximal prestretch, but the difference between prestretch and control groups decreased with time. In general, higher residual stresses were observed for product B than for product A, but this difference was not clinically significant.","Jee Hae Chang,Chung-Ju Hwang,Kyung-Ho Kim,Jung-Yul Cha,Kwang-Mahn Kim,Hyung Seog Yu","Orthodontic synthetic elastomeric chain,Permanent deformation,Prestretch,Stress relaxation."

Methods:Facial data were scanned using a white light scanner before and after MARPE in 30 patients. In total, 7 mm of expansion was achieved over a 4-week expansion period. We determined 10 soft tissue landmarks using reverse engineering software and measured 3D vector changes at those points. In addition, we calculated the distances between points to determine changes in the width of the nasal soft tissues. The volumetric change in the nose was also measured. Results:All landmarks except pronasale and subnasale showed statistically significant movement on the x-axis. Pronasale, subnasale, alar right, and alar left showed significant movement on the y-axis, while all landmarks except subnasale showed significant movement on the z-axis. The alar base width, alar width, and alar curvature width increased by 1.214, 0.932, and 0.987 mm, respectively. The average volumetric change was 993.33 mm3, and the amount of increase relative to the average initial volume was 2.96%. Conclusions:The majority of soft tissue landmarks around the nasal region show significant positional changes after MARPE in adults. The nose tends to widen and move forward and downward. The post-treatment nasal volume may also exhibit a significant increase relative to the initial volume. Clinicians should thoroughly explain the anticipated changes to patients before MARPE initiation.","Seung-Ryeol Lee,Jin-Woo Lee,Dong-Hwa Chung,Sang-Min Lee","MARPE,Nose,Soft tissue,Stereophotogrammetry."

Methods:Two types of PMMA blocks were tested: CAD-Temp® (VITA) and Telio® CAD (Ivoclar-Vivadent). The substrate was roughened with 320-grit sandpaper, simulating a fine-grit diamond bur. Two universal adhesives, Scotchbond Universal Adhesive (SU) and Assure Plus (AP), and a conventional adhesive, Transbond XT Primer (XTP; control), were used in combination with Transbond XT Paste to bond the brackets. Six experimental groups were formed: (1) CADTemp®/SU; (2) CAD-Temp®/AP; (3) CAD-Temp®/XTP; (4) Telio® CAD/SU; (5) Telio® CAD/AP; (6) Telio® CAD/XTP. Shear bond strength and ARI were assessed. On 1 extra block for each PMMA-based material surfaces were roughened with 180-grit sandpaper, simulating a normal/medium-grit (100 mm) diamond bur, and brackets were bonded. Shear bond strengths and ARI scores were compared with those of groups 3, 6. Results:On CAD-Temp® significantly higher bracket bond strengths than on Telio® CAD were recorded. With XTP significantly lower levels of adhesion were reached than using SU or AP. Roughening with a coarser bur resulted in a significant increase in adhesion. Conclusions:Bracket bonding to CAD/CAM PMMA can be promoted by grinding the substrate with a normal/medium-grit bur or by coating the intact surface with universal adhesives.

Methods:Three-dimensional UA models fabricated from cone beam computed tomography images obtained before (T0) and after (T1) MARPE in an adult patient with OSAS were used for computational fluid dynamics with fluid-structure interaction analysis. Seven and nine cross-sectional planes (interplane distance of 10 mm) in the nasal cavity (NC) and pharynx, respectively, were set along UA. Changes in the cross-sectional area and changes in airflow velocity and pressure, node displacement, and total resistance at maximum inspiration (MI), rest, and maximum expiration (ME) were investigated at each plane after MARPE. Results:The cross-sectional areas at most planes in NC and the upper half of the pharynx were significantly increased at T1. Moreover, airflow velocity decreased in the anterior NC at MI and ME and in the nasopharynx and oropharynx at MI. The decrease in velocity was greater in NC than in the pharynx. The airflow pressure in the anterior NC and entire pharynx exhibited a decrease at T1. The amount of node displacement in NC and the pharynx was insignificant at both T0 and T1. Absolute values for the total resistance at MI, rest, and ME were lower at T1 than at T0.

Methods:Thirty-eight patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion who underwent bimaxillary surgery were divided into two groups according to the use of preoperative orthodontic treatment: CS group (n = 18) and SF group (n = 20). Skeletal changes in both groups were measured using computed tomography before (T0), 2 days after (T1), and 1 year after (T2) the surgery. Three-dimensional (3D) angular changes in the mandibular proximal segment, condylar position, and maxillomandibular landmarks were assessed. Results:The mean amounts of mandibular setback and maxillary posterior impaction were similar in both groups. At T2, the posterior portion of the mandible moved upward in both groups. In the SF group, the anterior portion of the mandible moved upward by a mean distance of 0.9 ± 1.0 mm, which was statistically significant (p< 0.001). There were significant between-group differences in occlusal changes (p< 0.001) as well as in overjet and overbite. However, there were no significant between-group differences in proximal segment variables. Conclusions:Despite postoperative occlusal changes, positional changes in the mandibular proximal segment and the position of the condyles were similar between CS and SF, which suggested that SF using IVRO achieved satisfactory postoperative stability. If active physiotherapy is conducted, the proximal segment can be adapted in the physiological position regardless of the occlusal changes.","Seoyeon Jung,Yunjin Choi,Jung-Hyun Park,Young-Soo Jung,Hyoung-Seon Baik","Computed tomography,Intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy,Proximal segment,Surgery-first approach."

Methods:A three-dimensional finite element model was created for a segment of the six anterior teeth, and the positions of the miniscrews and hooks were varied after setting the alveolar bone loss to 0, 2, or 4 mm. Under 100 g of intrusive force, initial displacement of the individual teeth in three directions and the degree of labial tilting were measured. Results:The degree of labial tilting increased with reduced alveolar bone height under the same load. When a miniscrew was inserted between the two central incisors, the amounts of medial-lateral and anterior-posterior displacement of the central incisor were significantly greater than in the other conditions. When the miniscrews were inserted distally to the canines and an intrusion force was applied distal to the lateral incisors, the degree of labial tilting and the amounts of displacement of the six anterior teeth were the lowest, and the maximum von Mises stress was distributed evenly across all the teeth, regardless of the bone loss. Conclusions:Initial tooth displacement similar to pure intrusion of the six maxillary anterior teeth was induced when miniscrews were inserted distal to the maxillary canines and an intrusion force was applied distal to the lateral incisors. In this condition, the maximum von Mises stresses were relatively evenly distributed across all the teeth, regardless of the bone loss.","Sun-Mi Cho,Sung-Hwan Choi,Sang-Jin Sung,Hyung-Seog Yu,Chung-Ju Hwang","Bone loss,Finite element analysis,Intrusion,Miniscrew."

Results:Group 1 showed greater forward and downward displacements of the posterior maxilla (posterior nasal spine [PNS]-horizontal reference plane [HRP]; PNSVRP), greater increase in ANB, more forward tongue position (tongue tip-Pt vertical line to Frankfort horizontal plane), and greater increase in the oropharynx (superior posterior airway space [SPAS]; middle airway space [MAS]) and upper nasopharynx (PNS-adenoid2) than did Group 2. While maxillary advancement (A-VRP and PNS-VRP) correlated with increases in SPAS, MAS, and PNS-adenoid2, downward displacement of the PNS (PNS-HRP) correlated with increases in SPAS, MAS, PNSadenoid1, and PNS-adenoid2, and with a decrease in vertical airway length (VAL). Mandibular forward displacement and decrease in mandibular plane correlated with increases in MAS. Conclusions:FM-MP therapy had positive effects on the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airway spaces without increases in VAL in Group 1 rather than in Group 2. However, further validation using an untreated control group is necessary.","Jung-Eun Kim,Sunjin Yim,Jin-Young Choi,Sukwha Kim,Su-Jung Kim,Seung-Hak Baek","Facemask with miniplate,Growing patients with cleft lip and palate,Maxillary protraction,Pharyngeal airway dimension."
Analysis of midpalatal miniscrew-assisted maxillary molar distalization patterns with simultaneous use of fixed appliances: A preliminary study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26877983/,"Skeletal anchorage-assisted upper molar distalization has become one of the standard treatment modalities for the correction of Class II malocclusion. The purpose of this study was to analyze maxillary molar movement patterns according to appliance design, with the simultaneous use of buccal fixed orthodontic appliances. The authors devised two distinct types of midpalatal miniscrew-assisted maxillary molar distalizers, a lingual arch type and a pendulum type. Fourteen patients treated with one of the two types of distalizers were enrolled in the study, and the patterns of tooth movement associated with each type were compared. Pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalograms were analyzed. The lingual arch type was associated with relatively bodily upper molar distalization, while the pendulum type was associated with distal tipping with intrusion of the upper molar. Clinicians should be aware of the expected tooth movement associated with each appliance design. Further well designed studies with larger sample sizes are required.","Su-Jung Mah,Ji-Eun Kim,Eun Jin Ahn,Jong-Hyun Nam,Ji-Young Kim,Yoon-Goo Kang","Class II,Distalizing,Orthodontic mini-implant."
Comparison of treatment effects between the modified C-palatal plate and cervical pull headgear for total arch distalization in adults.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29090125/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dental and skeletal effects of the modified C-palatal plate (MCPP) for total arch distalization in adult patients with Class II malocclusion and compare the findings with those of cervical pull headgear. Methods:The study sample consisted of the lateral cephalograms of 44 adult patients with Class II Division 1 malocclusion, including 22 who received treatment with MCPP (age, 24.7 ± 7.7 years) and 22 who received treatment with cervical pull headgear (age, 23.0 ± 7.7 years). Pre- (T1) and post-treatment (T2) cephalograms were analyzed for 24 linear and angular measurements. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the changes after treatment in each group and differences in treatment effects between the two groups. Results:The mean amount of distalization at the crown and root levels of the maxillary first molar and the amount of distal tipping was 4.2 mm, 3.5 mm, and 3.9° in the MCPP group, and 2.3 mm, 0.6 mm, and 8.6° in the headgear group, respectively. In addition, intrusion by 2.5 mm was observed in the MCPP group. In both groups, the distal movement of the upper lip and the increase in the nasolabial angle were statistically significant (p< 0.001). However, none of the skeletal and soft tissue variables exhibited significant differences between the two groups. Conclusions:The results of this study suggest that MCPP is an effective treatment modality for total arch distalization in adults.","Chong Ook Park,Noor Laith Sa'aed,Mohamed Bayome,Jae Hyun Park,Yoon-Ah Kook,Young-Seok Park,Seong Ho Han","Class II,Headgear,Orthodontic implant,Palatal plate."
Factors affecting smile esthetics in adults with different types of anterior overjet malocclusion.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28127537/,"Objective:This study aimed to quantitatively assess the relationship of smile esthetic variables with various types of malocclusion, and identify the cephalometric factors affecting smile measurements. Methods:This retrospective study included 106 patients who were treated with retention at the orthodontic department of Taipei Medical University Hospital. Hard-tissue variables were measured using lateral cephalographic tracings, and nine smile esthetic variables were measured using facial photographs. The patients were divided into three groups according to their overjet (< 0, 0-4, and > 4 mm). An analysis of variance was conducted to compare the pretreatment cephalometric variables and smile esthetic variables among the three groups. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the cephalometric factors affecting the smile measurements in each group. Results:Except the upper midline and buccal corridor ratio, all of the smile measurements differed significantly among the three groups before orthodontic treatment. Some of the smile characteristics were correlated with the cephalometric measurements in different types of malocclusion. The overjet was the major factor influencing the smile pattern in all three types of malocclusion. Conclusions:Smile characteristics differ between different types of malocclusion; the smile may be influenced by skeletal pattern, dental procumbency, or facial type. These findings indicate that establishment of an optimal horizontal anterior teeth relationship is the key to improving the smile characteristics in different types of malocclusion.","Hsin-Chung Cheng,Pei-Chin Cheng","Esthetics,Malocclusion,Smile,Soft tissue."
Accuracy of three-dimensional printing for manufacturing replica teeth.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26445716/,"Objective:Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a recent technological development that may play a significant role in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment. It can be used to fabricate skull models or study models, as well as to make replica teeth in autotransplantation or tooth impaction cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of fabrication of replica teeth made by two types of 3D printing technologies. Methods:Fifty extracted molar teeth were selected as samples. They were scanned to generate high-resolution 3D surface model stereolithography files. These files were converted into physical models using two types of 3D printing technologies: Fused deposition modeling (FDM) and PolyJet technology. All replica teeth were scanned and 3D images generated. Computer software compared the replica teeth to the original teeth with linear measurements, volumetric measurements, and mean deviation measurements with best-fit alignment. Paired t-tests were used to statistically analyze the measurements. Results:Most measurements of teeth formed using FDM tended to be slightly smaller, while those of the PolyJet replicas tended to be slightly larger, than those of the extracted teeth. Mean deviation measurements with best-fit alignment of FDM and PolyJet group were 0.047 mm and 0.038 mm, respectively. Although there were statistically significant differences, they were regarded as clinically insignificant. Conclusions:This study confirms that FDM and PolyJet technologies are accurate enough to be usable in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment.","Keun-Young Lee,Jin-Woo Cho,Na-Young Chang,Jong-Moon Chae,Kyung-Hwa Kang,Sang-Cheol Kim,Jin-Hyoung Cho","Orthodontics,Three-dimensional printing,Tooth."
Evaluation of changes in the maxillary alveolar bone after incisor intrusion.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30450329/,"Objective:This study was performed to investigate the changes in alveolar bone after maxillary incisor intrusion and to determine the related factors in deep-bite patients. Methods:Fifty maxillary central incisors of 25 patients were evaluated retrospectively. The maxillary incisors in Group I (12 patients; mean age, 16.51 ± 1.32 years) were intruded with a base-arch, while those in Group II (13 patients; mean age, 17.47 ± 2.71 years) were intruded with miniscrews. Changes in the alveolar envelope were assessed using pre-intrusion and post-intrusion cone-beam computed tomography images. Labial, palatal, and total bone thicknesses were evaluated at the crestal (3 mm), midroot (6 mm), and apical (9 mm) levels. Buccal and palatal alveolar crestal height, buccal bone height, and the prevalence of dehiscence were evaluated. Two-way repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine the significance of the changes. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis was performed to assess the relationship between dental and alveolar bone measurement changes. Results:Upper incisor inclination and intrusion changes were significantly greater in Group II than in Group I. With treatment, the alveolar bone thickness at the labial bone thickness (LBT, 3 and 6 mm) decreased significantly in Group II (p< 0.001) as compared to Group I. The LBT change at 3 mm was strongly and positively correlated with the amount of upper incisor intrusion (r = 0.539;p= 0.005). Conclusions:Change in the labial inclination and the amount of intrusion should be considered during upper incisor intrusion, as these factors increase the risk of alveolar bone loss.","Ezgi Atik,Hande Gorucu-Coskuner,Bengisu Akarsu-Guven,Tulin Taner","Alveolar bone change,Cone-beam computed tomography,Intrusion,Maxillary incisor."
Disparity in opinions on lip protrusiveness in contemporary African American faces.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29291185/,"Objective:In accordance with the changing demographics in the United States, orthodontists working on various ethnic populations should be more conscious when using the standardized profile analyses for the African American patient. The objective of this study was to examine whether the perception of lip protrusiveness in modern African American faces has changed. For this purpose, we investigated the most favorable African American lip profile using the opinions of 10 experienced and 10 newly trained younger orthodontists. Methods:Attractiveness was converted to a number on visualized analog scales. Comparative ranks on 16 African American profiles, with focus on lip protrusiveness and thickness, were made among the groups. Mixed-effects linear regression models were fit and group differences were estimated. Results:Younger orthodontists favored a more protrusive lip profile, and the variance in their perceptions was narrower than those of older orthodontists. Measurements related to upper lip protrusion showed the strongest correlation to attractiveness (r = -0.82). The association with attractiveness decreased linearly as the protrusiveness of the upper lip increased. Steiner's E-line was the most influential reference for determining the level of attractiveness for the older orthodontists, whereas upper lip protrusion was the most influential factor for the young orthodontists. Conclusions:An adequate level of lip protrusiveness and thickness should be essential for maintaining attractive esthetics in African American patients. Yet, a new set of standards for prominent lips in this population is necessary to reflect the current trend in the concept of a beautiful face in the modern world.","Yvette Battle,Monica Schneider,Laurence Magder,Eung-Kwon Pae","African American,Esthetics,Generation gap,Lip protrusiveness."
"Effect of different combinations of bracket, archwire and ligature on resistance to sliding and axial rotational control during the first stage of orthodontic treatment: An in-vitro study.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30603622/,"Objective:This study was performed to explore the effect of different bracket, archwire, and ligature combinations on resistance to sliding (RS) and rotational control in first-order angulation. Methods:Three types of brackets (multi-level low friction [MLF], self-ligating, and conventional brackets) coupled with four nickel-titanium archwires (0.012, 0.014, 0.016, and 0.018-inch diameter) and two stainless steel ligatures (0.20 and 0.25 mm) were tested in different first-order angulations (0°, 2°, 4°, 6°, 8°, 10°, 15°, 20°) by using an Instron universal mechanical machine in the dry state at room temperature. RS value was evaluated and compared by one-way ANOVA. Results:Under the same angulation, the RS values showed the following order: conventional brackets > MLF brackets > self-ligating brackets. The RS was the highest for conventional brackets and showed a tendency to increase. The RS for MLF brackets coupled with thinner archwires and ligatures showed a similar tendency as the RS for the self-ligating bracket. In contrast, the RS for MLF brackets coupled with thicker archwires and ligatures increased like that for conventional brackets. MLF brackets showed the greatest range of critical contact angles in first-order angulation. Conclusions:The RS in first-order angulation is influenced by bracket design, archwire, and ligature dimension. In comparison with self-ligating and conventional brackets, MLF brackets could express low friction and rotational control with their greater range of critical contact angles.","Huizhong Chen,Bing Han,Tianmin Xu","Bracket,Physical property,Tooth movement."

An alternative pretreatment was explored to increase the pore volume of the surface layer of the WSLs. Also, the penetration effects of the infiltrant were evaluated for various pretreatments. Methods:Sixty two artificial lesions were fabricated on bovine teeth. As a positive control, 15% HCl gel was applied for 120 seconds. Further, 37% H3PO4 gel was applied for 30 seconds using three methods. The samples were divided as follows: H3PO4 only group, H3PO4 sponge group, and H3PO4 brush group. The acid was gently rubbed with the applicators (i.e., a sponge or brush) throughout the application time. To compare the effects of resin infiltration, twenty paired halves of specimens were treated with an infiltrant (ICON®). Results:Thicknesses of the removed surface layers and infiltrated areas were evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscope. The positive control and the 37% H3PO4 brush group failed to show significant differences in the removed thickness (p > 0.05); however, the mean percentage of the infiltrated area was higher in the 37% H3PO4 brush group (84.13 ± 7.58%) than the positive control (63.51 ± 7.62%, p < 0.001). Scanning electron microscope observations indicate higher pore volumes for the 37% H3PO4 brush group than for the positive control.

Color stability of laboratory glass-fiber-reinforced plastics for esthetic orthodontic wires.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26023541/,"Objective:In our previous study, glass-fiber-reinforced plastics (GFRPs) made from polycarbonate and glass fibers were prepared for esthetic orthodontic wires using pultrusion. These laboratory GFRP wires are more transparent than the commercially available nickel-titanium wire; however, an investigation of the color stability of GFRP during orthodontic treatment is needed. Accordingly, in the present study, the color stability of GFRP was assessed using colorimetry. Methods:Preparation of GFRP esthetic round wires (diameter: 0.45 mm [0.018 inch]) using pultrusion was described previously. Here, to investigate how the diameter of fiber reinforcement affects color stability, GFRPs were prepared by incorporating either 13-µm (GFRP-13) or 7-µm glass (GFRP-7) fibers. The color changes of GFRPs after 24 h, and following 1, 2, and 4 weeks of coffee immersion at 37℃, were measured by colorimetry. We evaluated the color stability of GFRPs by two evaluating units: the color difference (ΔE(*)) and National Bureau of Standards (NBS). Results:After immersion, both GFRPs showed almost no visible color change. According to the colorimetry measurements, the ΔE(*) values of GFRP-13 and GFRP-7 were 0.73-1.16, and 0.62-1.10, respectively. In accordance with NBS units, both GFRPs showed ""slight"" color changes. As a result, there were no significant differences in the ΔE(*) values or NBS units for GFRP-13 or GFRP-7. Moreover, for both GFRPs, no significant differences were observed in any of the immersion periods.

Methods:The samples comprised Korean adult twins and their siblings (mean age, 39.8 years; MZ group, n = 36 pairs; DZ group, n = 13 pairs of the same gender; and SIB group, n = 26 pairs of the same gender). Thirty cephalometric variables were measured to characterize facial profile, facial height, soft-tissue thickness, and projection of nose and lip. Falconer's method was used to calculate heritability (low heritability, h2< 0.2; high heritability, h2> 0.9). After principal components analysis (PCA) was performed to extract the models, we calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value and heritability of each component. Results:The MZ group exhibited higher ICC values for all cephalometric variables than DZ and SIB groups. Among cephalometric variables, the highest h2(MZ-DZ)and h2(MZ-SIB)values were observed for the nasolabial angle (NLA, 1.544 and 2.036), chin angle (1.342 and 1.112), soft tissue chin thickness (2.872 and 1.226), and upper lip thickness ratio (1.592 and 1.026).

Methods:Six models of maxillary protraction were developed: conventional facemask (Type A), facemask with dentoskeletal hybrid anchorage (Type B), facemask with a palatal plate (Type C), intraoral traction using a Class III palatal plate (Type D), facemask with a palatal plate combined with rapid maxillary expansion (RME; Type E), and Class III palatal plate intraoral traction with RME (Type F). In Types A, B, C, and D, maxillary protraction alone was performed, whereas in Types E and F, transverse expansion was performed simultaneously with maxillary protraction. Results:Type C displayed the greatest amount of anterior dentoskeletal displacement in the sagittal plane. Types A and B resulted in similar amounts of anterior displacement of all the maxillofacial landmarks. Type D showed little movement, but Type E with expansion and the palatal plate displayed a larger range of movement of the maxillofacial landmarks in all directions. Conclusions:The palatal plate served as an effective skeletal anchor for use with the facemask in maxillary protraction. In contrast, the intraoral use of Class III palatal plates showed minimal skeletal and dental effects in maxillary protraction. In addition, palatal expansion with the protraction force showed minimal effect on the forward movement of the maxillary complex.","Jusuk Eom,Mohamed Bayome,Jae Hyun Park,Hee Jin Lim,Yoon-Ah Kook,Seong Ho Han","Expansion,Facemask,Finite element model,Palatal plate."

The specimens were prepared for hematoxylin and eosin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. Suture opening and bone regeneration were evaluated using microcomputed tomography and bone histomorphometric analysis. Serum blood levels of osteocalcin and carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) were also evaluated. Results:TRAP-positive cell counts and CTX levels decreased while osteocalcin levels increased in the cetirizine-injected expansion group at observation day 28. In the expansion groups, the mineralized area gradually increased throughout the observation period. At day 28, the cetirizine-injected expansion group showed greater bone volume density, greater mineralized area, and narrower average suture width than did the PBS-injected expansion group. Conclusions:Cetirizine injection facilitated bone formation after suture expansion, mostly by suppressing osteoclastic activity. Histamine 1 receptor antagonists may aid in bone formation after calvarial suture expansion in the rat model.","Soonshin Hwang,Chooryung J Chung,Yoon Jeong Choi,Taeyeon Kim,Kyung-Ho Kim","Calvarial suture,Cetirizine,Rapid expansion,Rat model."
Orthodontic and orthopedic treatment for a growing patient with Tessier number 0 cleft.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29564221/,"The purpose of this case report was to introduce the concept of orthodontic and orthopedic treatment for a growing patient with Tessier number 0 cleft. A 5-year-old boy patient with Tessier number 0 cleft presented congenitally missing maxillary central incisors (MXCI), a bony defect at the premaxilla, a constricted maxillary arch, an anterior openbite, and maxillary hypoplasia. His treatment was divided into three stages: management of the bony defect at the premaxilla and the congenitally missing MXCIs using a fan-type expansion plate, iliac bone grafting, and eruption guidance of the maxillary lateral incisors into the graft area for substitution of MXCIs; management of the maxillary hypoplasia using sequential facemask therapy with conventional and skeletal anchorage; and management of the remaining occlusal problems using fixed orthodontic treatment. The total treatment duration was 15 years and 10 months. Class I canine and Class II molar relationships and normal overbite and overjet were achieved at the end of treatment. Although the long-term use of facemask therapy resulted in significant protraction of the retrusive maxilla, the patient exhibited Class III profile because of continued mandibular growth. However, the treatment result was well maintained after 2 years of retention. The findings from this case suggest that interdisciplinary and customized approaches are mandatory for successful management of maxillary hypoplasia, bony defect, and dental problems in Tessier number 0 cleft. Moreover, considering the potential of orthognathic surgery or distraction osteogenesis, meticulous monitoring of mandibular growth until growth completion is important.","Seung-Hak Baek,Yoon-Hee Park,Jee Hyeok Chung,Sukwha Kim,Jin-Young Choi","Growing patient,Orthodontic treatment,Orthopedic treatment,Tessier number 0 cleft."
Treatment of Class I crowding using simple tubes bonded with customized resin coverings: A case report.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30941298/,"As an alternative to the conventional fixed appliance that uses orthodontic brackets, a simple round tube without a bonding base can be bonded to the tooth surface by covering the tube with flowable resin. In this technique, bent wires cannot be inserted into the simple tubes; therefore, repositioning of the simple tubes is often required for adjustments. To reduce repositioning of simple tubes, a dome-shaped resin covering of the simple tube can be designed with a customized in-and-out compensation, using three-dimensional computer-aided design software based on digital simulation of orthodontic tooth movement. In the present case, the use of simple tubes bonded with customized resin coverings in a Class I nonextraction case is described in a 17-year-old male, in whom moderate crowding of the anterior teeth was treated over an 8-month period. This case shows that simple tubes can be used as an alternative to brackets in some Class I nonextraction cases, with the potential benefit of reducing decalcification.","Seo-Rin Jeong,Hye-In Kim,Sung-Hoon Lim","Appliance,Bracket,Computer-aided design,Digital simulation."

Methods:This single-center retrospective cohort study included all patients who presented to Seoul National University Dental Hospital for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2015. The study analyzed a set of heterogeneous variables grouped into the following categories: demographic (age, gender, and address), clinical (Angle Classification, anomaly, mode of orthodontic treatment, removable appliances for Phase 1 treatment, fixed appliances for Phase 2 treatment, orthognathic surgery, extraction, mini-plate, mini-implant, and patient transfer) and time-related variables (date of first visit and orthodontic treatment time). Time series analysis was applied to each variable. Results:The sample included 14,510 patients with a median age of 19.5 years. The number of patients and their ages demonstrated a clear seasonal variation, which peaked in the summer and winter. Increasing trends were observed for the proportion of male patients, use of non-extraction treatment modality, use of ceramic brackets, patients from provinces outside the Seoul region at large, patients transferred from private practitioners, and patients who underwent orthognathic surgery performed by university surgeons. Decreasing trends included the use of metal brackets and orthodontic treatment time.

Distalization pattern of whole maxillary dentition according to force application points.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25667914/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to observe stress distribution and displacement patterns of the entire maxillary arch with regard to distalizing force vectors applied from interdental miniscrews. Methods:A standard three-dimensional finite element model was constructed to simulate the maxillary teeth, periodontal ligament, and alveolar process. The displacement of each tooth was calculated on x, y, and z axes, and the von Mises stress distribution was visualized using color-coded scales. Results:A single distalizing force at the archwire level induced lingual inclination of the anterior segment, and slight intrusive distal tipping of the posterior segment. In contrast, force at the high level of the retraction hook resulted in lingual root movement of the anterior segment, and extrusive distal translation of the posterior segment. As the force application point was located posteriorly along the archwire, the likelihood of extrusive lingual inclination of the anterior segment increased, and the vertical component of the force led to intrusion and buccal tipping of the posterior segment. Rotation of the occlusal plane was dependent on the relationship between the line of force and the possible center of resistance of the entire arch. Conclusions:Displacement of the entire arch may be dictated by a direct relationship between the center of resistance of the whole arch and the line of action generated between the miniscrews and force application points at the archwire, which makes the total arch movement highly predictable.","Eui-Hyang Sung,Sung-Jin Kim,Youn-Sic Chun,Young-Chel Park,Hyung-Seog Yu,Kee-Joon Lee","Displacement,Distalization,Entire arch,Finite element,Occlusal plane."
Changes in force associated with the amount of aligner activation and lingual bodily movement of the maxillary central incisor.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27019820/,"Objective:The purposes of this study were to measure the orthodontic forces generated by thermoplastic aligners and investigate the possible influences of different activations for lingual bodily movements on orthodontic forces, and their attenuation. Methods:Thermoplastic material of 1.0-mm in thickness was used to manufacture aligners for 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 mm activations for lingual bodily movements of the maxillary central incisor. The orthodontic force in the lingual direction delivered by the thermoplastic aligners was measured using a micro-stress sensor system for the invisible orthodontic technique, and was monitored for 2 weeks. Results:Orthodontic force increased with the amount of activation of the aligner in the initial measurements. The attenuation speed in the 0.6 mm group was faster than that of the other groups (p < 0.05). All aligners demonstrated rapid relaxation in the first 8 hours, which then decreased slowly and plateaued on day 4 or 5. Conclusions:The amount of activation had a substantial influence on the orthodontic force imparted by the aligners. The results suggest that the activation of lingual bodily movement of the maxillary central incisor should not exceed 0.5 mm. The initial 4 or 5 days is important with respect to orthodontic treatment incorporating an aligner.","Xiaowei Li,Chaochao Ren,Zheyao Wang,Pai Zhao,Hongmei Wang,Yuxing Bai","Activation amount,Aligners,Orthodontic force,Orthodontic treatment."
Effect of carbonated water manufactured by a soda carbonator on etched or sealed enamel.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29291188/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of carbonated water on etched or sealed enamel according to the carbonation level and the presence of calcium ions. Methods:Carbonated water with different carbonation levels was manufactured by a soda carbonator. Seventy-five premolar teeth were randomly divided into a control group and 4 experimental groups in accordance with the carbonation level and the presence of calcium ions in the test solutions. After specimen preparation of the Unexposed, Etched, and Sealed enamel subgroups, all the specimens were submerged in each test solution for 15 minutes three times a day during 7 days. Microhardness tests on the Unexposed and Etched enamel subgroups were performed with 10 specimens from each group.

Microhardness changes in different groups were statistically compared using pairedt-tests, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results:The microhardness changes were significantly different between the groups (p= 0.000). The microhardness changes in all experimental groups except Group 3 (low-level carbonated water with calcium ions) were significantly greater than those in the Control group. SEM showed that etched areas of the specimen were affected by carbonated water and the magnitude of destruction varied between groups.

Three-dimensional analysis of the distal movement of maxillary 1st molars in patients fitted with mini-implant-aided trans-palatal arches.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26445718/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate three-dimensional molar displacement after distalization via miniscrews and a horizontal modification of the trans-palatal-arch (TPA). Methods:The subjects in this clinical trial were 26 Class II patients. After the preparation of a complete set of diagnostic records, miniscrews were inserted between the maxillary 2nd premolar and 1st molar on the palatal side. Elastic modules connected to the TPA exerting an average force of 150-200 g/side parallel to the occlusal plane were applied. Cone-beam computed tomography was utilized to evaluate the position of the miniscrews relative to the adjacent teeth and maxillary sinus, and the direction of force relative to molar furcation. The distances from the central point of the incisive papilla to the mesiopalatal cusps of the 1st maxillary molars and the distances between the mesiopalatal cusps of the left and right molars were measured to evaluate displacement of the maxillary molars on the horizontal plane. Interocclusal space was used to evaluate vertical changes. Results:Mean maxillary 1st molar distalization was 2.3 ± 1.1 mm, at a rate of 0.4 ± 0.2 mm/month, and rotation was not significant. Intermolar width increased by 2.9 ± 1.8 mm. Molars were intruded relative to the neighboring teeth, from 0.1 to 0.8 mm. Conclusions:Distalization of molars was possible without extrusion, using the appliance investigated. The intrusive component of force reduced the rate of distal movement.","Amirfarhang Miresmaeili,Ahmad Sajedi,Abbas Moghimbeigi,Nasrin Farhadian","Dental models,Orthodontic anchorage procedures,Tooth movement."

Maxillary protraction using customized mini-plates for anchorage in an adolescent girl with skeletal Class III malocclusion.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32938827/,"The treatment of skeletal Class III malocclusion in adolescents is challenging. Maxillary protraction, particularly that using bone anchorage, has been proven to be an effective method for the stimulation of maxillary growth. However, the conventional procedure, which involves the surgical implantation of mini-plates, is traumatic and associated with a high risk. Three-dimensional (3D) digital technology offers the possibility of individualized treatment. Customized miniplates can be designed according to the shape of the maxillary surface and the positions of the roots on cone-beam computed tomography scans; this reduces both the surgical risk and patient trauma. Here we report a case involving a 12-year-old adolescent girl with skeletal Class III malocclusion and midface deficiency that was treated in two phases. In phase 1, rapid maxillary expansion and protraction were performed using 3D-printed mini-plates for anchorage. The mini-plates exhibited better adaptation to the bone contour, and titanium screw implantation was safer because of the customized design. The orthopedic force applied to each mini-plate was approximately 400-500 g, and the plates remained stable during the maxillary protraction process, which exhibited efficacious orthopedic effects and significantly improved the facial profile and esthetics. In phase 2, fixed appliances were used for alignment and leveling of the maxillary and mandibular dentitions. The complete two-phase treatment lasted for 24 months. After 48 months of retention, the treatment outcomes remained stable.","Shuran Liang,Xianju Xie,Fan Wang,Qiao Chang,Hongmei Wang,Yuxing Bai","Customized mini-plates,Face mask,Implant design,Threedimensional printing."

Caspases are important effector molecules for apoptosis. At present, little is known about the mechanisms underlying ORR and apoptosis in the cementum. The aim of the presentin vivostudy was to investigate the expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), caspase 3, caspase 8, and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) in the cementum in response to a heavy or an optimum orthodontic force. Methods:The maxillary molars of male Wistar rats were subjected to an orthodontic force of 10 g or 50 g using a closed coil spring. The rats were sacrificed each experimental period on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after orthodontic force application. And the rats were subjected to histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Results:On day 7 for the 50-g group, hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed numerous root resorption lacunae with odontoclasts on the root, while immunohistochemistry showed increased TRAP- and RANKL-positive cells. Caspase 3- and caspase 8-positive cells were increased on the cementum surfaces in the 50-g group on days 3 and 5. Moreover, the number of caspase 3- and caspase 8-positive cells and RANKL-positive cells was significantly higher in the 50-g group than in the 10-g group.

Methods:In this study, 80 extracted human premolars were randomly divided into eight groups of 10 samples each. Metal or polycrystalline ceramic brackets were bonded on the teeth using second- or third-generation LED light-curing units (LCUs), according to the manufacturers' instructions. The shear bond strengths were measured using the universal testing machine, and the adhesive remnant index (ARI) was scored by assessing the residual resin on the surfaces of debonded teeth using a scanning electron microscope. In addition, curing times were also measured. Results:The shear bond strengths in all experimental groups were higher than the acceptable clinical shear bond strengths, regardless of the curing unit used. In both LED LCU groups, all ceramic bracket groups showed significantly higher shear bond strengths than did the metal bracket groups except the plasma emulation group which showed no significant difference. When comparing units within the same bracket type, no differences in shear bond strength were observed between the second- and third-generation unit groups. Additionally, no significant differences were observed among the groups for the ARI.

Methods:AP and PA cephalograms were generated from CBCT scans obtained from 25 adults. Four experienced and four inexperienced examiners were selected depending on their experience levels in analyzing frontal cephalograms. They identified six cephalometric landmarks on AP and PA cephalograms. The errors incurred in positioning the cephalometric landmarks on the AP and PA cephalograms were calculated by using the straight-line distance and the horizontal and vertical components as parameters. Results:Comparison of the landmark identification errors in CBCT-generated frontal cephalograms revealed that landmark-dependent differences were greater than experience- or projection-dependent differences. Comparisons of landmark identification errors in the horizontal and vertical directions revealed larger errors in identification of the crista galli and anterior nasal spine in the vertical direction and the menton in the horizontal direction, in comparison with the other landmarks. Comparison of landmark identification errors between the AP and PA projections in CBCT-generated images revealed a slightly higher error rate in the AP projections, with no inter-examiner differences. Statistical testing of the differences in landmark identification errors between AP and PA cephalograms showed no statistically significant differences for all landmarks. Conclusions:The reproducibility of CBCT-generated AP cephalograms is comparable to that of PA cephalograms; therefore, AP cephalograms can be generated reliably from CBCT scan data in clinical settings.","Eui-Ri Na,Hussein Aljawad,Kyung-Min Lee,Hyeon-Shik Hwang","Anteroposterior cephalogram,Posteroanterior cephalogram,cone-beam computed tomography."

Methods:Male Wistar rats were divided into control, heavy force (HF), optimal force (OF), and jiggling force (JF) groups. The expression levels of cathepsin K, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 protein, interleukin (IL)-6, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 (CINC-1; an IL-8-related protein in rodents), receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin protein in the dental root were determined using immunohistochemistry. Results:On day 21, a greater number of root resorption lacunae, which contained multinucleated odontoclasts, were observed in the palatal roots of rats in the JF group than in rats from other groups. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the numbers of cathepsin K-positive and MMP-9-positive odontoclasts in the JF group on day 21. Immunoreactivities for IL-6, CINC-1, and RANKL were stronger in resorbed roots exposed to jiggling than in the other groups on day 21. Negative reactivity was observed in the controls.

Methods:Forty-seven young female adult patients were enrolled in this study (skeletal Class III patients were excluded), including 34 lip-protruding patients treated by extraction of four first premolars (18 patients requiring mini-implants for maximum anchorage control and 16 patients without mini-implants) and 13 patients requiring non-extraction treatment. Nine angles, seven distances, and the surface area of the lip vermilion were measured by using pre- and post-treatment three-dimensional facial scans. Linear and angular measurements of incisors were performed on lateral cephalograms. Results:There were no significant changes in the vermilion measurements in the non-extraction group. The vermilion angle, vermilion height, central bow angle, height/width ratio, and vermilion surface area decreased significantly after the orthodontic treatment in the extraction groups, but the upper/lower vermilion proportion remained unchanged. Significant correlations were found between the changes in incisor position and those in vermilion angles, vermilion height, and surface area. Conclusions:Extraction of the four first premolars probably produced an aesthetic improvement in lip vermilion morphology. However, the upper/lower vermilion proportion remained unchanged. The variations in the vermilion were closely related to incisor changes, especially the upper incisor inclination changes.","Zhi-Yu Liu,Jie Yu,Fan-Fan Dai,Ruo-Ping Jiang,Tian-Min Xu","Adult treatment,Incisor changes,Lip vermilion,Three-dimensional scanner."

Total arch distalization with interproximal stripping in a patient with severe crowding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31149610/,"When a patient shows severe crowding, premolar extraction should be considered to provide required available space for alignment. If the third molars have already erupted and demonstrate a poor prognosis, third molar extraction and distalization of the posterior dentition can be used instead of premolar extraction to obtain space. Interproximal stripping (IPS) may also be used to gain space in cases of crowding. This case report describes the treatment of a 25-year-old man with severe crowding and mild lip protrusion. Although the crowding in the lower arch was severe enough to require first premolar extraction, distalization of the entire lower dentition with orthodontic mini-implants, extraction of the lower third molars, and IPS could successfully resolve the crowding and lip protrusion.",Min-Ho Jung,"Distalization,Interproximal stripping,Orthodontic mini-implant."

Histomorphometric evaluation of the bone surrounding orthodontic miniscrews according to their adjacent root proximity.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30206527/,"Objective:This study was conducted to perform histomorphometric evaluations of the bone surrounding orthodontic miniscrews according to their proximity to the adjacent tooth roots in the posterior mandible of beagle dogs. Methods:Four male beagle dogs were used for this study. Six orthodontic miniscrews were placed in the interradicular spaces in the posterior mandible of each dog (n = 24). The implanted miniscrews were classified into no loading, immediate loading, and delayed loading groups according to the loading time. At 6 weeks after screw placement, the animals were sacrificed, and tissue blocks including the miniscrews were harvested for histological examinations. After analysis of the histological sections, the miniscrews were categorized into three additional groups according to the root proximity: high root proximity, low root proximity, and safe distance groups. Differences in the bone-implant contact (BIC, %) among the root proximity groups and loading time groups were determined using statistical analyses. Results:No BIC was observed within the bundle bone invaded by the miniscrew threads. Narrowing of the periodontal ligament space was observed in cases where the miniscrew threads touched the bundle bone. BIC (%) was significantly lower in the high root proximity group than in the low root proximity and safe distance groups. However, BIC (%) showed no significant differences among the loading time groups. Conclusions:Regardless of the loading time, the stability of an orthodontic miniscrew is decreased if it is in contact with the bundle bone as well as the adjacent tooth root.","Hyun-Ju Oh,Jung-Yul Cha,Hyung-Seog Yu,Chung-Ju Hwang","Bone–implant contact,Bundle bone,Miniscrew,Root proximity."

"A three-dimensional finite element analysis of molar distalization with a palatal plate, pendulum, and headgear according to molar eruption stage.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27668192/,"Objective:This study aimed to (1) evaluate the effects of maxillary second and third molar eruption status on the distalization of first molars with a modified palatal anchorage plate (MPAP), and (2) compare the results to the outcomes of the use of a pendulum and that of a headgear using three-dimensional finite element analysis. Methods:Three eruption stages were established: an erupting second molar at the cervical one-third of the first molar root (Stage 1), a fully erupted second molar (Stage 2), and an erupting third molar at the cervical one-third of the second molar root (Stage 3). Retraction forces were applied via three anchorage appliance models: an MPAP with bracket and archwire, a bone-anchored pendulum appliance, and cervical-pull headgear. Results:An MPAP showed greater root movement of the first molar than crown movement, and this was more noticeable in Stages 2 and 3. With the other devices, the first molar showed distal tipping. Transversely, the first molar had mesial-out rotation with headgear and mesial-in rotation with the other devices. Vertically, the first molar was intruded with an MPAP, and extruded with the other appliances. Conclusions:The second molar eruption stage had an effect on molar distalization, but the third molar follicle had no effect. The application of an MPAP may be an effective treatment option for maxillary molar distalization.","Ju-Man Kang,Jae Hyun Park,Mohamed Bayome,Moonbee Oh,Chong Ook Park,Yoon-Ah Kook,Sung-Seo Mo","Class II,Distalizing,Headgear,Palatal plate."

A linear mixed model was used to cluster posterior teeth into maxillary premolar, maxillary molar, mandibular premolar, and mandibular molar groups. Differences among Class I, II, and III groups were compared using an analysis of variance test and least significant differencepost-hoctest. Correlations of posterior dental inclinations to occlusal function were analyzed using Pearson's correlation analysis. Results:In male subjects, maxillary premolars and molars had the smallest inclinations in the Class II group while maxillary molars had the greatest inclinations in the Class III group. In female subjects, maxillary molars had the smallest inclinations in the Class II group, while maxillary premolars and molars had the greatest inclinations in the Class III group. Occlusal force and contact area were not significantly different among Class I, II, and III groups. Conclusions:Premolar and molar inclinations showed compensatory inclinations to overcome anteroposterior skeletal discrepancy in the Class II and III groups; however, their occlusal force and contact area were similar to those of Class I group. In subjects with normodivergent facial patterns, although posterior tooth inclinations may vary, difference in occlusal function may be clinically insignificant in adults with Class I, II, and III malocclusions.","Soonshin Hwang,Yoon Jeong Choi,Sooin Jung,Sujin Kim,Chooryung J Chung,Kyung-Ho Kim","Cone beam computed tomography,Occlusal force,Sagittal skeletal malocclusion."

A new type of clear orthodontic retainer incorporating multi-layer hybrid materials.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26445722/,"Clear thermoplastic retainers have been widely used in daily orthodontics; however, they have inherent limitations associated with thermoplastic polymer materials such as dimensional instability, low strength, and poor wear resistance. To solve these problems, we developed a new type of clear orthodontic retainer that incorporates multi-layer hybrid materials. It consists of three layers; an outer polyethylenterephthalate glycol modified (PETG) hard-type polymer, a middle thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) soft-type polymer, and an inner reinforced resin core. The resin core improves wear resistance and mechanical strength, which prevent unwanted distortion of the bucco-palatal wall of the retainer. The TPU layer absorbs impact and the PETG layer has good formability, optical qualities, fatigue resistance, and dimensional stability, which contributes to increased support from the mandibular dentition, and helps maintain the archform. This new type of vacuum-formed retainer showed improved mechanical strength and rate of water absorption.","Hyo-Won Ahn,Kyung A Kim,Seong-Hun Kim","Polyethylenterephthalate glycol modified,Retention,Thermoplastic,Thermoplastic polyurethane."

Relationship between maturation indices and morphology of the midpalatal suture obtained using cone-beam computed tomography images.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27896208/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to determine whether predicting maturation of the midpalatal suture is possible by classifying its morphology on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images and to investigate relationships with other developmental age indices. Methods:The morphology of the midpalatal suture was assessed by using CBCT images of 99 patients. Axial plane images of the midpalatal suture were classified into five stages according to the classification scheme. To make the assessment more accurate, the morphology and fusion of the midpalatal suture were additionally investigated on coronal cross-sectional planar images and volume-rendered images. Bone age was evaluated using the hand and wrist method (HWM) and cervical vertebrae method (CVM); dental age (Hellman's index), sex, and chronological age were also assessed. To evaluate relationships among variables, Spearman's rho rank test was performed along with crosstabs using contingency coefficients. Results:The HWM and CVM showed strong correlations with the maturation stage of the midpalatal suture, while other indices showed relatively weak correlations (p< 0.01). Through crosstabs, the HWM and CVM showed high association values with CBCT stage; the HWM demonstrated slightly higher values (p< 0.0001).

Effects of continuous force application for extrusive tipping movement on periapical root resorption in the rat mandibular first molar.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30206533/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of continuous force application for extrusive tipping movement and occlusal interference on periapical root resorption in the rat mandibular first molar. Methods:We constructed an appliance comprising a titanium screw implant with a cobalt-chromium post as the anchorage unit and a nickel-titanium closed coil spring (50 cN) as the active unit. Force was applied on the mandibular left first molar of rats for 8 (n = 10) and 15 days (n = 10; experimental groups), with the tooth in occlusion. Five rats were included as a non-treated control group to examine the body effect of the appliance. Active root resorption lacunae, identified using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, were evaluated in terms of the length, depth, and area. Results:The rat mandibular first molars were mesially tipped and extruded in the occlusal direction. This mesio-occlusal tipping movement and occlusion resulted in the formation of a compression zone and active root resorption lacunae in the distoapical third of the distal roots. However, there was no significant difference in the amount of root resorption between the two experimental groups. The control group did not exhibit any active root resorption lacunae. Conclusions:Periapical root resorption was induced by continuous extrusive tipping force and occlusal interference in rat mandibular molars. These data suggest that we orthodontists had better take care not to induce occlusal interference during our orthodontic treatment.","Yoshiro Matsumoto,Siripen Sringkarnboriboon,Takashi Ono","Apical root resorption,Mechanical stimuli,Rat mandibular molar,Tooth movement."

Methods:We designed 10 experimental groups following the surface treatment and thermocycling. The surface was treated with one of the following method: no-primer (NP), Porcelain Conditioner (PC), Z-PRIME Plus (ZP), Monobond Plus (MP) and Zirconia Liner Premium (ZL) (n=20). Then each group was subdivided to non-thermocycled and thermocycled groups (NPT, PC, ZPT, MPT, ZLT) (n=10). Orthodontic brackets were bonded to the specimens using Transbond™ XT Paste and light cured for 15 s at 1,100 mW/cm(2). The SBS was measured at a 1 mm/min crosshead speed. The failure mode was assessed by examination with a stereomicroscope and the amount of bonding resin remaining on the zirconia surface was scored using the modified adhesive remnant index (ARI). Results:The SBS of all experimental groups decreased after thermocycling. Before thermocycling, the SBS was ZL, ZP ≥ MP ≥ PC > NP but after thermocycling, the SBS was ZLT ≥ MPT ≥ ZPT > PCT = NPT (p > 0.05). For the ARI score, both of the groups lacking primer (NP and NPT) displayed adhesive failure modes, but the groups with zirconia primers (ZP, ZPT, MP, MPT, ZL, and ZLT) were associated with mixed failure modes.

CBCT images acquired preoperatively, 1 month after surgery, and 1 year after surgery were analyzed to compare the intergroup differences in postoperative three-dimensional movements of the maxillary and mandibular landmarks and the changes in lateral cephalometric variables. Results:Baseline demographics (sex and age) were similar between the two groups (6 men and 6 women in each group). During the postsurgical period, the POGS group showed more significant upward movement of the mandible (p < 0.05) than did the CS group. Neither group showed significant transverse movement of any of the skeletal landmarks. Moreover, none of the dental and skeletal variables showed significant intergroup differences 1 year after surgery. Conclusions:Compared with CS, POGS with IVRO resulted in significantly different postsurgical skeletal movement in the mandible. Although both groups showed similar skeletal and dental outcomes at 1 year after surgery, upward movement of the mandible during the postsurgical period should be considered to ensure a more reliable outcome after POGS.","Hye-Rim Ann,Young-Soo Jung,Kee-Joon Lee,Hyoung-Seon Baik","Computed tomography,Intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy,Preorthodontic orthognathic surgery,Skeletal Class III."
Aspartate aminotransferase activity in the pulp of teeth treated for 6 months with fixed orthodontic appliances.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26445721/,"Objective:To measure aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity in the pulp of teeth treated with fixed appliances for 6 months, and compare it with AST activity measured in untreated teeth. Methods:The study sample consisted of 16 healthy subjects (mean age 25.7 ± 4.3 years) who required the extraction of maxillary premolars for orthodontic reasons. Of these, 6 individuals had a total of 11 sound teeth extracted without any orthodontic treatment (the control group), and 10 individuals had a total of 20 sound teeth extracted after 6 months of orthodontic alignment (the experimental group). Dental pulp samples were extracted from all control and experimental teeth, and the AST activity exhibited by these samples was determined spectrophotometrically at 20℃. Results:Mean AST values were 25.29 × 10(-5) U/mg (standard deviation [SD] 9.95) in the control group and 27.54 × 10(-5) U/mg (SD 31.81) in the experimental group. The difference between these means was not statistically significantly (p = 0.778), and the distribution of the AST values was also similar in both groups. Conclusions:No statistically significant increase in AST activity in the pulp of mechanically loaded teeth was detected after 6 months of orthodontic alignment, as compared to that of teeth extracted from individuals who had not undergone orthodontic treatment. This suggests that time-related regenerative processes occur in the dental pulp.","Rita Veberiene,Dalia Latkauskiene,Vilma Racinskaite,Neringa Skucaite,Vita Machiulskiene","Aspartate aminotransferase activity,Dental pulp,Orthodontic treatment."
Evaluation of digital dental models obtained from dental cone-beam computed tomography scan of alginate impressions.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27226958/,"Objective:To investigate the dimensional accuracy of digital dental models obtained from the dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan of alginate impressions according to the time elapse when the impressions are stored under ambient conditions. Methods:Alginate impressions were obtained from 20 adults using 3 different alginate materials, 2 traditional alginate materials (Alginoplast and Cavex Impressional) and 1 extended-pour alginate material (Cavex ColorChange). The impressions were stored under ambient conditions, and scanned by CBCT immediately after the impressions were taken, and then at 1 hour intervals for 6 hours. After reconstructing three-dimensional digital dental models, the models were measured and the data were analyzed to determine dimensional changes according to the elapsed time. The changes within the measurement error were regarded as clinically acceptable in this study. Results:All measurements showed a decreasing tendency with an increase in the elapsed time after the impressions. Although the extended-pour alginate exhibited a less decreasing tendency than the other 2 materials, there were no statistically significant differences between the materials. Changes above the measurement error occurred between the time points of 3 and 4 hours after the impressions. Conclusions:The results of this study indicate that digital dental models can be obtained simply from a CBCT scan of alginate impressions without sending them to a remote laboratory. However, when the impressions are not stored under special conditions, they should be scanned immediately, or at least within 2 to 3 hours after the impressions are taken.","Tingting Jiang,Sang-Mi Lee,Yanan Hou,Xin Chang,Hyeon-Shik Hwang","Alginate impression,Dental cone-beam computed tomography,Digital dental model,Dimensional accuracy."
"Facial and occlusal esthetic improvements of an adult skeletal Class III malocclusion using surgical, orthodontic, and implant treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26877982/,"The aim of this clinical report is to describe the complex treatment of an adult Class III malocclusion patient who was disappointed with the outcome of a previous oral rehabilitation. Interdisciplinary treatment planning was performed with a primary indication for implant removal because of marginal bone loss and gingival recession, followed by orthodontic and surgical procedures to correct the esthetics and skeletal malocclusion. The comprehensive treatment approach included: (1) implant removal in the area of the central incisors; (2) combined orthodontic decompensation with mesial displacement and forced extrusion of the lateral incisors; (3) extraction of the lateral incisors and placement of new implants corresponding to the central incisors, which received provisional crowns; (4) orthognathic surgery for maxillary advancement to improve occlusal and facial relationships; and finally, (5) orthodontic refinement followed by definitive prosthetic rehabilitation of the maxillary central incisors and reshaping of the adjacent teeth. At the three-year follow-up, clinical and radiographic examinations showed successful replacement of the central incisors and improved skeletal and esthetic appearances. Moreover, a Class II molar relationship was obtained with an ideal overbite, overjet, and intercuspation. In conclusion, we report the successful esthetic anterior rehabilitation of a complex case in which interdisciplinary treatment planning improved facial harmony, provided gingival architecture with sufficient width and thickness, and improved smile esthetics, resulting in enhanced patient comfort and satisfaction. This clinical case report might be useful to improve facial esthetics and occlusion in patients with dentoalveolar and skeletal defects.","Mauricio de Almeida Cardoso,Rafael Scaf de Molon,Erica Dorigatti de Avila,Fabio Pinto Guedes,Valter Antonio Ban Battilani Filho,Leopoldino Capelozza Filho,Marcio Aurelio Correa,Hugo Nary Filho","Dental implants,Esthetics,Orthodontics,Orthognathic surgery."
Alveolar restoration following rapid maxillary expansion with and without corticotomy: A microcomputed tomography study in sheep.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31367578/,"Objective:This study examined bone microstructure restoration after rapid maxillary expansion (RME) with and without corticotomy over multiple retention periods. Methods:Eighteen male Dorper sheep were randomly distributed into three groups (n = 6 each group): group 1, RME with corticotomy on the buccal and palatal sides; group 2, conventional RME treatment; and group 3, no treatment. Post-RME, trabecular bone microstructure and new bone formation were evaluated by using microcomputed tomography (microCT) and histomorphometry after a 4- or 12-week retention period. Intergroup differences in bone quality and bone remodeling were analyzed by using two-way analysis of variance with Bonferronipost-hoctest. Results:The bone volume fraction (bone volume [BV]/total volume [TV]) values relative to the control in groups 1 and 2 were 54.40% to 69.88% after the 4-week retention period and returned to approximately 80% after the 12-week retention period. The pooled BV/TV values of the banded teeth in groups 1 and 2 were significantly lower than those of the control after the 4-week retention period (p< 0.05). However, after the 12-week retention period, the pooled BV/TV values in group 2 were significantly lower than those in groups 1 and 3 (p< 0.05). Histomorphological analysis showed that the new bone formation area in group 1 was approximately two to three times of those in group 2 and control. Conclusions:Corticotomy significantly enhanced the restoration of bone quality after the retention periods for banded teeth. This benefit might result from the increased new bone formation after corticotomy.","My Huy Thuc Le,Abu Kasim Noor Hayaty,Zuraiza Mohamad Zaini,Sulaiman Md Dom,Norliza Ibrahim,Zamri Bin Radzi","Bone microstructure,Corticotomy,Microcomputed tomography,Rapid maxillary expansion."
Zygomatic miniplates for skeletal anchorage in orthopedic correction of Class III malocclusion: A controlled clinical trial.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28337421/,"Objective:To evaluate the effects of facemask therapy, which was anchored from the zygomatic buttresses of the maxilla by using two miniplates, in skeletal Class III patients with maxillary deficiency. Methods:Eighteen skeletal Class III patients (10 girls and 8 boys; mean age, 11.4 ± 1.28 years) with maxillary deficiency were treated using miniplate-anchored facemasks, and their outcomes were compared with those of a Class III control group (9 girls and 9 boys; mean age, 10.6 ± 1.12 years). Two I-shaped miniplates were placed on the right and left zygomatic buttresses of the maxilla, and a facemask was applied with a 400 g force per side. Intragroup comparisons were made using the Wilcoxon test, and intergroup comparisons were made using the Mann-WhitneyU-test (p< 0.05). Results:In the treatment group, the maxilla moved 3.3 mm forward, the mandible showed posterior rotation by 1.5°, and the lower incisors were retroclined after treatment. These results were significantly different from those in the control group (p< 0.05). No significant anterior rotation of the palatal plane was observed after treatment. Moreover, changes in the sagittal positions of the maxillary incisors and molars were similar between the treatment and control groups. Conclusions:Skeletally anchored facemask therapy is an effective method for correcting Class III malocclusions, which also minimizes the undesired dental side effects of conventional methods in the maxilla.","Erdal Bozkaya,Alime Sema Yüksel,Süleyman Bozkaya","Class III,Facemask,Miniplate,Skeletal anchorage."
Effects of bodily retraction of mandibular incisors versus mandibular setback surgery on pharyngeal airway space: A comparative study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29090122/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to compare the changes induced in the pharyngeal airway space by orthodontic treatment with bodily retraction of the mandibular incisors and mandibular setback surgery without extraction. Methods:This retrospective study included 63 adult patients (32 men and 31 women). Thirty-three patients who had been treated via four-bicuspid extraction and bodily retraction of the mandibular incisors (incisor retraction, IR group) were compared with 30 patients who had been treated via mandibular setback surgery (MS group) without extraction. Lateral cephalograms were acquired and analyzed before (T1) and after treatment (T2). Results:The superior pharyngeal airway space did not change significantly in either group during treatment. The middle pharyngeal airway space decreased by 1.15 ± 1.17 mm and 1.25 ± 1.35 mm after treatment in the IR and MS groups, respectively, and the decrease was comparable between the two groups. In the MS group, the inferior pharyngeal airway space (E-IPW) decreased by 0.88 ± 1.67 mm after treatment (p< 0.01). The E-IPW was larger in the MS group than in IR group at T1, but it did not differ significantly between the two groups at T2. No significant correlation was observed between changes in the pharyngeal airway space and the skeletal and dental variables in each group. Conclusions:The middle pharyngeal airway space decreased because of the posterior displacement of the mandibular incisors and/or the mandibular body. The E-IPW decreased only in the MS group because of the posterior displacement of only the mandibular body.","Byeong-Tak Keum,Sung-Hwan Choi,Yoon Jeong Choi,Hyoung-Seon Baik,Kee-Joon Lee","Bodily retraction,Mandibular setback surgery,Miniscrew,Pharyngeal airway space."
Effect of labiolingual inclination of a maxillary central incisor and surrounding alveolar bone loss on periodontal stress: A finite element analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27226961/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to investigate whether labial tooth inclination and alveolar bone loss affect the moment per unit of force (Mt/F) in controlled tipping and consequent stresses on the periodontal ligament (PDL). Methods:Three-dimensional models (n = 20) of maxillary central incisors were created with different labial inclinations (5°, 10°, 15°, and 20°) and different amounts of alveolar bone loss (0, 2, 4, and 6 mm). The Mt/F necessary for controlled tipping (Mt/Fcont) and the principal stresses on the PDL were calculated for each model separately in a finite element analysis. Results:As labial inclination increased, Mt/Fcont and the length of the moment arm decreased. In contrast, increased alveolar bone loss caused increases in Mt/Fcont and the length of the moment arm. When Mt/F was near Mt/Fcont, increases in Mt/F caused compressive stresses to move from a predominantly labial apical region to a palatal apical position, and tensile stresses in the labial area moved from a cervical position to a mid-root position. Although controlled tipping was applied to the incisors, increases in alveolar bone loss and labial tooth inclination caused increases in maximum compressive and tensile stresses at the root apices. Conclusions:Increases in alveolar bone loss and labial tooth inclination caused increases in stresses that might cause root resorption at the root apex, despite the application of controlled tipping to the incisors.","Sung-Hwan Choi,Young-Hoon Kim,Kee-Joon Lee,Chung-Ju Hwang","Alveolar bone loss,Controlled tipping,Labial tooth inclination,Periodontal stress."

Methods:The subjects were 40 adult patients (20 females and 20 males; mean age, 20.3 ± 3.0 years; range, 17.0 to 31.1 years) who underwent one-piece Le Fort I osteotomy with maxillary advancement and impaction treatment for maxillary hypoplasia. The mean maxillary advancement was 4.56 ± 1.34 mm, and the mean maxillary impaction was 2.03 ± 1.04 mm. Stereophotogrammetry was used to acquire three-dimensional images before and at least 6 months after surgery. Results:Alare (Al) and alare curvature (Ac) points had moved vertically and anterolaterally postoperatively. A significant increase was observed in the nasal ala width and alar base width, and no changes were noted in the columellar length, nasolabial angle, and nasal area. There was a significant relationship between maxillary impaction and nasal ala width and horizontal and sagittal positions of the bilateral Al and Ac. The only relationship found was between maxillary advancement and postoperative sagittal location of the subnasale and pronasale. Conclusions:Nasal soft tissues were highly affected by the vertical movement of the maxilla; however, the soft tissue responses were individual-dependent.","Gokhan Coban,Ibrahim Yavuz,Busra Karadas,Ahmet Emin Demirbas","3D stereophotogrammetry,Class III orthognathic surgery,Soft tissue nasal changes."
Reference points suitable for evaluation of the additional arch length required for leveling the curve of Spee.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27896209/,"Objective:The additional arch length required for leveling (AALL) the curve of Spee (COS) can be estimated by subtracting the two-dimensional (2D) arch circumference, which is the projection of the three-dimensional (3D) arch circumference onto the occlusal plane, from the 3D arch circumference, which represents the arch length after leveling the COS. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the cusp tips or proximal maximum convexities are more appropriate reference points for estimating the AALL. Methods:Sixteen model setups of the mandibular arch with COS depths ranging from 0 mm to 4.7 mm were constructed using digital simulation. Arch circumferences in 2D and 3D were measured from the cusp tips and proximal maximum convexities and used to calculate the AALL. The values obtained using the two reference points were compared with the pairedt-test. Results:Although the 3D arch circumference should be constant regardless of the COS depth, it decreased by 3.8 mm in cusp tip measurements and by 0.4 mm in proximal maximum convexity measurements as the COS deepened to 4.7 mm. AALL values calculated using the cusp tips as reference points were significantly smaller than those calculated using the proximal maximum convexities (p= 0.002). Conclusions:The AALL is underestimated when the cusp tips are used as measurement reference points; the AALL can be measured more accurately using the proximal maximum convexities.","Yong-Hwa Cho,Sung-Hoon Lim,Sung-Nam Gang","3-Dimensional diagnosis and treatment planning,Curve of Spee,Dental cast analysis,Digital models."
Effect of passive self-ligating bracket placement on the posterior teeth on reduction of frictional force in sliding mechanics.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27019821/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to investigate the static (SFF) and kinetic frictional forces (KFF) in sliding mechanics of hybrid bracket systems that involve placing a conventional bracket (CB) or active self-ligating bracket (ASLB) on the maxillary anterior teeth (MXAT) and a passive SLB (PSLB) on the maxillary posterior teeth (MXPT). Methods:The samples consisted of two thoroughbred types (group 1, anterior-CB + posterior-CB; group 2, anterior-ASLB + posterior-ASLB) and four hybrid types (group 3, anterior-CB + posterior-PSLB-type 1; group 4, anterior-CB + posterior-PSLB-type 2; group 5, anterior-ASLB + posterior-PSLB-type 1; group 6, anterior-ASLB + posterior-PSLB-type 2) (n = 13 per group). After maxillary dentition alignment and maxillary first premolars removal in the stereolithographically-made typodont system, a 0.019 × 0.025-inch stainless steel wire was drawn through the right quadrant of the maxillary arch at 0.5 mm/min for 5 min. The SFF and KFF were measured with a mechanical testing machine and statistical analyses were performed. Results:Four different categories of SFF and KFF were observed among all groups (all p < 0.001). Group 1 demonstrated the highest SFF and KFF; groups 4 and 3 were second and third highest, respectively. The fourth category included groups 2, 5, and 6. Placing PSLBs on the MXPT resulted in significant SFF and KFF reductions in cases with CBs on the MXAT, but not in cases with ASLBs on the MXAT.

Three-dimensional evaluation of alveolar changes induced by nasoalveolar molding in infants with unilateral cleft lip and palate: A case-control study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31598485/,"Objective:The objectives of this study were to evaluate linear and volumetric alveolar changes induced by nasoalveolar molding (NAM) in infants with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) and compare the maxillary dimensions after NAM with the normal dimensions in infants without clefts. Methods:A total of 26 infants with UCLP treated by NAM (mean age before and after NAM: 14.20 ± 8.09 days and 118.16 ± 10.06 days, respectively) comprised the treatment group, while 26 infants without clefts (mean age: 115.81 ± 8.71 days) comprised the control group. Changes in the maxillary dimensions following NAM were measured on three-dimensional models using Mimics software, version 17.0. Results:During NAM, there was a decrease in the cleft widths, maxillary arch depths, and rotation of the greater segment. While the anterior alveolar arch width exhibited a significant decrease, the posterior arch width was mostly maintained. There were no changes in the anterior vertical deviations of the alveolar segments. The alveolar crest lengths, arch circumference, and bilateral posterior volumetric measures exhibited an increase. After NAM, the anterior arch width was comparable between the treatment and control groups, whereas the posterior arch width and anterior vertical deviations were greater in the treatment group than in the control group. The maxillary arch depths, alveolar crest lengths, and maxillary volumes were smaller in the NAM group than in the control group. Conclusions:During NAM in infants with UCLP, the cleft width and anteroposterior and transverse alveolar dimensions exhibited a decrease while the vertical dimensions were maintained. Compared with infants without clefts, those with UCLP treated by NAM exhibited sagittal and vertical alveolar growth deficiencies and tissue insufficiency.","Merve Altay Burgaz,Derya Germec Cakan,R Burcu Nur Yılmaz","Alveolar changes,Nasoalveolar molding,Three-dimensional analysis,Unilateral cleft lip and palate."
Management of open bite that developed during treatment for internal derangement and osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26023542/,"This case report describes the orthodontic treatment performed for open bite caused by internal derangement (ID) and osteoarthritis (OA) of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). A Japanese woman, aged 31 years and 11 months, referred to our department by an oral surgeon had an open bite with clockwise rotation of the mandible and degeneration of the condyle. The overbite was corrected through intrusion of the maxillary and mandibular molars using mini-screw implants to induce counterclockwise rotation of the mandible. Then, the mandibular second premolars were extracted and comprehensive orthodontic treatment was performed to establish a Class I molar relationship with distalization of the maxillary arch and to eliminate anterior crowding. Following treatment, her facial profile improved and a functional and stable occlusion was achieved without recurrence of the TMJ symptoms. These results suggest that orthodontic intrusion of the molars is one of the safer and less stressful alternatives for the management of open bite due to degeneration of the condyles caused by ID and OA of TMJ.","Chihiro Arai,Jae Won Choi,Kazutoshi Nakaoka,Yoshiki Hamada,Yoshiki Nakamura","Internal derangement,Mini-screw implant,Osteoarthritis,Temporomandibular joint."
Psychosocial impact of malocclusion in Spanish adolescents.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24015389/,"Objective:To evaluate the psychosocial impact of malocclusion, determine its relationship with the severity of malocclusion, and assess the influence of gender and social class on this relationship in adolescents. Methods:A random sample of 627 Spanish adolescents aged 12 - 15 years underwent intraoral examinations by 3 calibrated examiners (intraexaminer and interexaminer kappa > 0.85) at their schools. Psychosocial impact was measured through a self-rated Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire (PIDAQ). The severity of malocclusion was measured by the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN). Gender and social class were also recorded. Results:The total PIDAQ score and those of its 4 subscales, social impact, psychological impact, aesthetic concern, and dental self-confidence, presented significant differences (p ≤ 0.05 by analysis of variance) and linear relationships with the IOTN grades (p ≤ 0.05 by linear regression). Stepwise linear regression models showed that the IOTN dental health component was a predictive variable of the total and subscale PIDAQ scores. Neither gender nor social class was an independent predictive variable of this relationship, except the linear model for psychological impact, where gender was a predictive variable. The occlusal conditions responsible for higher PIDAQ scores were increased overjet, impeded eruption, tooth displacement, and increased overbite. Conclusions:Malocclusion has a psychological impact in adolescents and this impact increases with the severity of malocclusion. Social class may not influence this association, but the psychological impact seems to be greater among girls.","Carlos Bellot-Arcís,José María Montiel-Company,José Manuel Almerich-Silla","Epidemiology,Public health."
Resin bonding of metal brackets to glazed zirconia with a porcelain primer.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26629476/,"Objective:The aims of this study were to compare the shear bond strength between orthodontic metal brackets and glazed zirconia using different types of primer before applying resin cement and to determine which primer was more effective.

Methods:In total, 17 women who underwent nonextraction orthodontic treatment and 15 women who underwent orthodontic treatment with extraction of all four first premolars were included in this retrospective study. For all patients, lateral cephalograms and dental models were measured before (T0) and after (T1) treatment. In addition, MLF was measured at both time points using the Lip De Cum LDC-110R® device. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate changes in clinical variables and MLF and their correlations. Results:Both groups showed similar skeletal patterns, although the extraction group showed greater proclination of the maxillary and mandibular incisors and lip protrusion compared to the nonextraction group at T0. MLF at T0 was comparable between the two groups. The reduction in the arch width and depth and incisor retroclination from T0 to T1 were more pronounced in the extraction group than in the nonextraction group. MLF in the extraction group significantly increased during the treatment period, and this increase was significantly greater than that in the nonextraction group. The increase in MLF was found to be correlated with the increase in the interincisal angle and decrease in the intermolar width, arch depth, and incisor-mandibular plane angle.

The novel method was used to achieve a positive result in a case of moderate crowding by employing a computer-guided piezocision procedure followed by the use of clear aligners. A 23-year-old woman had a malocclusion with moderate crowding. Her periodontal indices, oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), and treatment time were evaluated. The treatment included interproximal corticotomy cuts extending through the entire thickness of the cortical layer, without a full-thickness flap reflection. This was achieved with a three-dimensionally printed surgical guide using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing. Orthodontic force was applied to the teeth immediately after surgery by using clear appliances for better control of tooth movement. The total treatment time was 8 months. The periodontal indices improved after crowding correction, but the oral health impact profile showed a slight deterioration of OHRQoL during the 3 days following surgery. At the 2-year retention follow-up, the stability of treatment was excellent. The reduction in surgical time and patient discomfort, increased periodontal safety and patient acceptability, and accurate control of orthodontic movement without the risk of losing anchorage may encourage the use of this combined technique in appropriate cases.","Michele Cassetta,Federica Altieri,Stefano Pandolfi,Matteo Giansanti","Accelerated orthodontics,CAD-CAM,Clear aligners,Piezocision."

Methods:0.016-inch nickel titanium (NiTi) wires and 0.017 × 0.025-inch stainless steel (SS) wires were used, and the angulations between the brackets and wires were set to 0°, 5°, and 10°. Upper maxillary premolar brackets (Clippy-C®) with a 0.022-inch slot were selected for the study and a tensile test was performed with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. The maximum static frictional forces and kinetic frictional forces were recorded and compared. Results:The maximum static frictional forces and the kinetic frictional forces of coated wires were equal to or higher than those of the uncoated wires (p < 0.05). The maximum static frictional forces of rhodium-coated wires were significantly higher than those of polymer-coated wires when the angulations between the brackets and wires were set to (i) 5° in the 0.016-inch NiTi wires and (ii) all angulations in the 0.017 × 0.025-inch SS wires (p < 0.05).

Effect of activation and preactivation on the mechanical behavior and neutral position of stainless steel and beta-titanium T-loops.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26258066/,"Objective:To quantify, for each activation, the effect of preactivations of differing distribution and intensity on the neutral position of T-loops (7-mm height), specifically the horizontal force, moment to force (M/F) ratio, and load to deflection ratio. Methods:A total 100 loops measuring 0.017 × 0.025 inches in cross-section were divided into two groups (n = 50 each) according to composition, either stainless steel or beta-titanium. The two groups were further divided into five subgroups, 10 loops each, corresponding to the five preactivations tested: preactivations with occlusal distribution (0°, 20°, and 40°), gingival distribution (20°), and occlusal-gingival distribution (40°). The loops were subjected to a total activation of 6-mm with 0.5-mm iterations. Statistical analysis was performed using comprised ANOVA and Bonferoni multiple comparison tests, with a significance level of 5%. Results:The location and intensity of preactivation influenced the force intensity. For the M/F ratio, the highest value achieved without preactivation was lower than the height of the loop. Without preactivation, the M/F ratio increased with activation, while the opposite effect was observed with preactivation. The increase in the M/F ratio was greater when the preactivation distribution was partially or fully gingival. Conclusions:Depending on the preactivation distribution, displacement of uprights is higher or lower than the activation, which is a factor to consider in clinical practice.","Saúl Matos de Castro,Rui Moreira,Ana Cristina Braga,Afonso Pinhão Ferreira,Maria Cristina Pollmann","Neutral position,Preactivation,T-loop."
Predictors of favorable soft tissue profile outcomes following Class II Twin-block treatment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29291184/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to determine cephalometric factors that help predict favorable soft-tissue profile outcomes following treatment with the Class II Twin-block appliance. Methods:Pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalograms of 45 patients treated with the Class II Twin-block appliance were retrospectively analyzed. Profile silhouettes were drawn from the cephalograms and evaluated by three orthodontists in order to determine the extent of improvement. Samples were divided into a favorable group (upper 30% of visual analogue scale [VAS] scores, n = 14) and an unfavorable group (lower 30% of VAS scores, n = 14). Skeletal and soft-tissue measurements were performed on the cephalograms and an intergroup comparison was conducted. Results:An independentt-test revealed that the following pre-treatment values were lower in the favorable group compared to the unfavorable group: lower incisor to mandibular plane angle, lower incisor to pogonion distance, point A-nasion-point B angle, sella-nasion line (SN) to maxillary plane angle, SN to mandibular plane angle, gonial angle, and symphysis inclination. The favorable group had a larger incisor inclination to occlusal plane. Moreover, the favorable group showed larger post-treatment changes in gonial angle, B point projection, and pogonion projection than did the unfavorable group. Conclusions:Class II malocclusion patients with a low divergent skeletal pattern and reduced lower incisor protrusions are likely to show more improvement in soft-tissue profile outcomes following Class II Twin-block treatment.","Ji-Eun Kim,Su-Jung Mah,Tae-Woo Kim,Su-Jung Kim,Ki-Ho Park,Yoon-Goo Kang","Cephalometric predictors,Class II Twin-block,Soft-tissue profile."
Evaluation of the facial dimensions of young adult women with a preferred facial appearance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26445720/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the facial dimensions of young adult women with a preferred facial appearance and compare the results with those from the general population. Methods:Twenty-five linear, nine angular, and three area measurements were made and four ratios were calculated using a sample of standardized frontal and lateral photographs of 46 young adult women with a preferred facial appearance (Miss Korea group) and 44 young adult women from the general population (control group). Differences between the two groups were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Results:Compared with the control group, the Miss Korea group exhibited a significantly greater facial height, total facial height (TFH; trichion-menton), facial width (tragus right-tragus left), facial depth (tragus-true vertical line), and trichion-nasion/TFH ratio and smaller subnasale-menton/TFH and facial width/TFH ratios. Furthermore, the control group had smaller intercanthal and interpupillary widths. Conclusions:The Miss Korea group exhibited longer, wider, and deeper faces compared with those from the general population. Furthermore, the Miss Korea group had larger eyes, longer but less protruded noses, longer and more retruded lower lips and chins, larger lip vermilion areas, and smaller labiomental angles. These results suggest that the latest trends in facial esthetics should be considered during diagnosis and treatment planning for young women with dentofacial abnormalities.","Sae Yong Kim,Mohamed Bayome,Jae Hyun Park,Yoon-Ah Kook,Ju Hee Kang,Kang Hyuk Kim,Hong-Beom Moon","Facial profile,Frontal soft tissue,Lips,Preferred facial appearance."

Alveolar bone thickness around maxillary central incisors of different inclination assessed with cone-beam computed tomography.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26445719/,"Objective:To assess the labial and lingual alveolar bone thickness in adults with maxillary central incisors of different inclination by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods:Ninety maxillary central incisors from 45 patients were divided into three groups based on the maxillary central incisors to palatal plane angle; lingual-inclined, normal, and labial-inclined. Reformatted CBCT images were used to measure the labial and lingual alveolar bone thickness (ABT) at intervals corresponding to every 1/10 of the root length. The sum of labial ABT and lingual ABT at the level of the root apex was used to calculate the total ABT (TABT). The number of teeth exhibiting alveolar fenestration and dehiscence in each group was also tallied. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's honestly significant difference test were applied for statistical analysis. Results:The labial ABT and TABT values at the root apex in the lingual-inclined group were significantly lower than in the other groups (p < 0.05). Lingual and labial ABT values were very low at the cervical level in the lingual-inclined and normal groups. There was a higher prevalence of alveolar fenestration in the lingual-inclined group. Conclusions:Lingual-inclined maxillary central incisors have less bone support at the level of the root apex and a greater frequency of alveolar bone defects than normal maxillary central incisors. The bone plate at the marginal level is also very thin.","Yu-Lou Tian,Fang Liu,Hong-Jing Sun,Pin Lv,Yu-Ming Cao,Mo Yu,Yang Yue","Alveolar bone thickness,Cone-beam computed tomography,Inclination,Maxillary central incisors."

Methods:Sixty adult patients were classified into symmetry and asymmetry groups based on the menton deviation on postero-anterior radiographs. The right/left differences of 3D measurements were compared between the two groups, and measurements were compared separately on the right and left sides. The correlations between menton deviation and the right/left differences were analyzed. Results:The mediolateral dimension, neck length, condylar angles to the anteroposterior reference (PO) and midsagittal reference planes, and neck and head volumes showed significantly larger right/left differences in the asymmetry group compared to the symmetry group. Separate comparisons of the right and left sides between the two groups showed that the neck was significantly shorter and neck and head volumes were significantly smaller on the left side, which was deviated side in the asymmetry group. Pearson's correlation analysis showed significant positive correlations of menton deviation with right/left differences in neck length, condylar angle to the PO plane, and neck and head volumes in the asymmetry group.

Cone-beam computed tomography-based diagnosis and treatment simulation for a patient with a protrusive profile and a gummy smile.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29732305/,"For patients with bimaxillary protrusion, significant retraction and intrusion of the anterior teeth are sometimes essential to improve the facial profile. However, severe root resorption of the maxillary incisors occasionally occurs after treatment because of various factors. For instance, it has been reported that approximation or invasion of the incisive canal by the anterior tooth roots during retraction may cause apical root damage. Thus, determination of the position of the maxillary incisors is key for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning in such cases. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) may be useful for simulating the post-treatment position of the maxillary incisors and surrounding structures in order to ensure safe teeth movement. Here, we present a case of Class II malocclusion with bimaxillary protrusion, wherein apical root damage due to treatment was minimized by pretreatment evaluation of the anatomical structures and simulation of the maxillary central incisor movement using CBCT. Considerable retraction and intrusion of the maxillary incisors, which resulted in a significant improvement in the facial profile and smile, were achieved without severe root resorption. Our findings suggest that CBCT-based diagnosis and treatment simulation may facilitate safe and dynamic orthodontic tooth movement, particularly in patients requiring maximum anterior tooth retraction.","Shunsuke Uesugi,Toshihiro Imamura,Satoshi Kokai,Takashi Ono","Bimaxillary protrusion,Cone-beam computed tomography,Digital simulation,Orthodontic mini-implant."

Methods:The control group consisted of 30 young adults (15 men, 15 women) without any severe skeletal deformity. The asymmetry group included 55 adults (28 men, 27 women) with skeletal Class III deformity and at least 3-mm menton deviation from the midsagittal plane; it was divided into the hyperdivergent and hypodivergent subgroups using a mandibular plane angle cutoff of 35°. Fourteen rotational variables of the dental arches and mandible were measured and compared among the groups. Correlations between menton deviation and the other variables were evaluated. Results:The asymmetry group showed significantly larger measurements of roll and yaw in the mandible than the control group. The hypodivergent subgroup showed significant differences in maxillary posterior measurements of yaw (p < 0.01) and maxillary anterior shift (p < 0.05) compared with the hyperdivergent subgroup. All the mandibular measurements had significant correlations with menton deviation (p < 0.01). Most measurements of roll were positively correlated with one another (p < 0.01). Measurements of yaw and roll in the posterior regions were also positively correlated (p < 0.05). Conclusions:Menton deviation in skeletal Class III deformity with mandibular asymmetry is influenced by rotation of mandibular posterior dentofacial structures.

Methods:Six 3D facial images were acquired using a 3D facial scanner (euryprosopic [Eury-FFT], mesoprosopic [Meso-FFT], and leptoprosopic [Lepto-FFT] for each sex). After normal CP in each 3D facial image was set to 10° of the facial profile angle (glabella-subnasale-pogonion), CPs were morphed by gradations of 2° from normal (moderately protrusive [6°], slightly protrusive [8°], slightly retrusive [12°], and moderately retrusive [14°]). Seventy-five dental students (48 men and 27 women) were asked to rate the CPs (6°, 8°, 10°, 12°, and 14°) from the most to least preferred in each 3D image. Statistical analyses included the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Bonferroni correction. Results:No significant difference was observed in the distribution of preferred CP in the same FFT between male and female evaluators. In Meso-FFT, the normal CP was the most preferred without any sex difference. However, in Eury-FFT, the slightly protrusive CP was favored in male 3D images, but the normal CP was preferred in female 3D images.

Patients (mean age 21.58 ± 2.94 years) were randomized into two groups to receive either passive self-ligating (Damon® 3MX, n = 23) or conventional system (Gemini MBT, n = 24) orthodontic treatment. Direct measurements of the final sample comprising 20 study models per group were performed using a digital caliper at the debonding stage, and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after debonding. Pairedt-test, independentt-test, and non-parametric test were used for statistical analysis. Results:A significant increase (p< 0.01) in incisor irregularity was observed in both self-ligating and conventional system groups. A significant reduction (p< 0.01) in second interpremolar width was observed in both groups. Mandibular arch length decreased significantly (p= 0.001) in the conventional system group but not in the self-ligating system group. A similar pattern of stability was observed for intercanine width, first interpremolar width, intermolar width, and arch depth throughout the 6-month retention period after debonding. Comparison of incisor irregularity and arch dimension changes between self-ligating system and conventional system groups during the 6 months were non-significant. Conclusions:The stability of treatment outcomes for mild to moderate crowding malocclusions was similar between the self-ligating system and conventional system during the first 6 months of retention.","Norma Ab Rahman,Mang Chek Wey,Siti Adibah Othman","Conventional system,Malocclusions,Self-ligating system,Stability."

Biologic stability of plasma ion-implanted miniscrews.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814706/,"Objective:To gain basic information regarding the biologic stability of plasma ion-implanted miniscrews and their potential clinical applications. Methods:Sixteen plasma ion-implanted and 16 sandblasted and acid-etched (SLA) miniscrews were bilaterally inserted in the mandibles of 4 beagles (2 miniscrews of each type per quadrant). Then, 250 - 300 gm of force from Ni-Ti coil springs was applied for 2 different periods: 12 weeks on one side and 3 weeks contralaterally. Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and mandibular specimens including the miniscrews were collected. The insertion torque and mobility were compared between the groups. The bone-implant contact and bone volume ratio were calculated within 800 µm of the miniscrews and compared between the loading periods. The number of osteoblasts was also quantified. The measurements were expressed as percentages and analyzed by independent t-tests (p < 0.05). Results:No significant differences in any of the analyzed parameters were noted between the groups. Conclusions:The preliminary findings indicate that plasma ion-implanted miniscrews have similar biologic characteristics to SLA miniscrews in terms of insertion torque, mobility, bone-implant contact rate, and bone volume rate.","Young-Chae Cho,Jung-Yul Cha,Chung-Ju Hwang,Young-Chel Park,Han-Sung Jung,Hyung-Seog Yu","Histology,Orthodontic mini-implant,Stability,Surface treatment."
Three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography analysis of temporomandibular joint response to the Twin-block functional appliance.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32257934/,"Objective:To propose a three-dimensional (3D) method for evaluating temporomandibular joint (TMJ) changes during Twin-block treatment. Methods:Seventeen patients with Class II division 1 malocclusion treated using Twin-block and nine untreated patients with a similar malocclusion were included in this research. We collected their cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) data from before and 8 months after treatment. Segmentations were constructed using ITK-SNAP. Condylar volume and superficial area were measured using 3D Slicer. The 3D landmarks were identified on CBCT images by using Dolphin software to assess the condylar positional relationship. 3D models of the mandible and glenoid fossa of the patients were constructed and registered via voxel-based superimposition using 3D Slicer. Thereafter, skeletal changes could be visualized using 3DMeshMetric in any direction of the superimposition on a color-coded map. All the superimpositions were measured using the same scale on the distance color-coded map, in which red color represents overgrowth and blue color represents resorption. Results:Significant differences were observed in condylar volume, superficial area, and condylar position in both groups after 8 months. Compared with the control group (CG), the Twin-block group exhibited more obvious condyle-fossa modifications and joint positional changes. Moreover, on the color-coded map, more obvious condyle-fossa modifications could be observed in the posterior and superior directions in the Twin-block group than in the CG. Conclusions:We successfully established a 3D method for measuring and evaluating TMJ changes caused by Twin-block treatment. The treatment produced a larger condylar size and caused condylar positional changes.","Yuan-Yuan Jiang,Lian Sun,Hua Wang,Chun-Yang Zhao,Wei-Bing Zhang","Computed tomography,Functional,Temporomandibular joint,Three-dimensional cephalometrics."
Colorimetric evaluation of white spot lesions following external bleaching with fluoridation: An in-vitro study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30450330/,"Objective:This study was performed to investigate the effects of external tooth bleaching with flouridation on the appearance of white spot lesions (WSLs)in vitro. Methods:In total, 125 bracket-bonded bovine incisor enamel blocks with artificial WSLs were randomly divided into a control group and four treatment groups (home bleaching, home bleaching + fluoridation, in-office bleaching, and in-office bleaching + fluoridation). A spectroradiometer (SR) and digital images (DIs) were used to evaluate colorimetric parameters (Commission Internationale l'Eclairage L*a*b*) for all specimens. Color measurements were obtained before WSL formation (T1), after WSL formation (T2), and after completion of the external tooth bleaching treatment (T3). Results:The SR-based color change after bleaching was significantly greater in the treatment groups than in the control group (p< 0.05). SR-based lightness (L*) and red-green (a*) values were significantly higher at T2 than at T1 (p< 0.001), with no significant changes in yellow-blue (b*) values. At T3, SR-based L*values had increased while a*and b*values had decreased in the treatment groups (p< 0.001). The DI-based color difference between the sound enamel and WSL areas (ΔE*DI) increased significantly from T1 to T2 in all groups (p< 0.001) and significantly decreased from T2 to T3 in the treatment groups (p< 0.001). No significant differences in ΔE*DI at T3 were shown between the four treatment groups (p> 0.05).

Targeted presurgical decompensation in patients with yaw-dependent facial asymmetry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28523246/,"Facial asymmetry can be classified into the rolling-dominant type (R-type), translation-dominant type (T-type), yawing-dominant type (Y-type), and atypical type (A-type) based on the distorted skeletal components that cause canting, translation, and yawing of the maxilla and/or mandible. Each facial asymmetry type represents dentoalveolar compensations in three dimensions that correspond to the main skeletal discrepancies. To obtain sufficient surgical correction, it is necessary to analyze the main skeletal discrepancies contributing to the facial asymmetry and then the skeletal-dental relationships in the maxilla and mandible separately. Particularly in cases of facial asymmetry accompanied by mandibular yawing, it is not simple to establish pre-surgical goals of tooth movement since chin deviation and posterior gonial prominence can be either aggravated or compromised according to the direction of mandibular yawing. Thus, strategic dentoalveolar decompensations targeting the real basal skeletal discrepancies should be performed during presurgical orthodontic treatment to allow for sufficient skeletal correction with stability. In this report, we document targeted decompensation of two asymmetry patients focusing on more complicated yaw-dependent types than others: Y-type and A-type. This may suggest a clinical guideline on the targeted decompensation in patient with different types of facial asymmetries.","Kyung-A Kim,Ji-Won Lee,Jeong-Ho Park,Byoung-Ho Kim,Hyo-Won Ahn,Su-Jung Kim","Decompensation,Facial asymmetry,Mandibular yaw,Orthognathic surgery."
The effect of silver ion-releasing elastomers on mutans streptococci in dental plaque.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112937/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of silverized elastomers on mutans streptococci in dental plaque. Methods:Forty patients undergoing orthodontic treatment were randomly placed into 1 of 2 groups. We examined the maxillary right and left central incisors and premolars, and the mandibular right and left canines of all participants. We ligated the right maxillary and left mandibular teeth of the participants in group 1 with silverized elastomers and ligated their contralateral teeth with conventional elastomers. We ligated the left maxillary teeth and right mandibular teeth of group 2 participants with silverized elastomers. Each participant visited the clinic 4 times at 3-week intervals. We applied the elastomers to the teeth on one side of each patient's mouth during their first visit. During the second visit, the elastomers were removed for microbiological analysis and replaced with steel ligatures. During the third visit, we used silverized elastomers to ligate the teeth contralateral to those treated on the first visit. The elastomers were removed during the fourth visit, and microbiological analyses were performed. We compared the quantity of bacteria on silverized and conventional elastomers at the 0.05 level of significance. Results:The percentage of mutans streptococci was not significantly different in cultures of dental plaque from the silverized and the conventional elastomers (p > 0.05).

Multidisciplinary management of a fused maxillary central incisor moved through the midpalatal suture: A case report.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29090126/,"Fusion of teeth is a developmental anomaly. It occurs at the stage of tooth formation, which determines the shape and size of the tooth crown, when one or more teeth fuse at the dentin level during the morphodifferentiation of the dental germs. Such teeth show macrodontia and may cause crowding, as well as esthetic and endodontic problems. In this article, we report a rare case of a maxillary central incisor fused to a supernumerary tooth showing labial and palatal talon cusps, which was orthodontically moved across the midpalatal suture. A 13-year-old Caucasian boy sought treatment for the unesthetic appearance of his maxillary central incisor and anterior crowding. He was rehabilitated successfully via a multidisciplinary approach involving orthodontic, nonsurgical endodontic, periodontal, and prosthodontic treatments. After a 26-month treatment period, the patient's macroesthetics and microesthetics were improved. The overall improvement of this macrodontic tooth and its surrounding tissues through multidisciplinary treatment was documented using cone-beam computed tomography.","Hakan Bulut,Aylin Pasaoglu","Fusion,Macrodontia,Midline crossing,Midpalatal suture,Talon cusp."
Frictional property comparisons of conventional and self-ligating lingual brackets according to tooth displacement during initial leveling and alignment: an in vitro mechanical study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27019823/,"Objective:We evaluated the effects of tooth displacement on frictional force when conventional ligating lingual brackets (CL-LBs), CL-LBs with a narrow bracket width, and self-ligating lingual brackets (SL-LBs) were used with initial leveling and alignment wires. Methods:CL-LBs (7th Generation), CL-LBs with a narrow bracket width (STb), and SL-LBs (In-Ovation L) were tested under three tooth displacement conditions: no displacement (control); a 2-mm palatal displacement (PD) of the maxillary right lateral incisor (MXLI); and a 2-mm gingival displacement (GD) of the maxillary right canine (MXC) (nine groups, n = 7 per group). A stereolithographic typodont system and artificial saliva were used. Static and kinetic frictional forces (SFF and KFF, respectively) were measured while drawing a 0.013-inch copper-nickel-titanium archwire through brackets at 0.5 mm/min for 5 minutes at 36.5℃. Results:The In-Ovation L exhibited lower SFF under control conditions and lower KFF under all displacement conditions than the 7th Generation and STb (all p < 0.001). No significant difference in SFF existed between the In-Ovation L and STb for a 2-mm GD of the MXC and 2-mm PD of the MXLI. A 2-mm GD of the MXC produced higher SFF and KFF than a 2-mm PD of the MXLI in all brackets (all p < 0.001). Conclusions:CL-LBs with narrow bracket widths exhibited higher KFF than SL-LBs under tooth displacement conditions. CL-LBs and ligation methods should be developed to produce SFF and KFF as low as those in SL-LBs during the initial and leveling stage.","Do-Yoon Kim,Bum-Soon Lim,Seung-Hak Baek","Frictional force,Initial leveling and alignment,Lingual bracket,Tooth displacement."
Adjunctive buccal and palatal corticotomy for adult maxillary expansion in an animal model.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29564219/,"Objective:This study aimed to explore the usefulness of adjunctive buccal and palatal corticotomy for adult maxillary expansion in an animal model using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods:Twelve adult sheep were randomly divided into two groups (each n = 6): a control group, where no treatment was administered, and a treatment group, where buccal and palatal corticotomy-assisted maxillary expansion was performed. CBCT scans were taken before (T1) and after (T2) treatment. Differences in all transverse dental and alveolar dimensions, alveolar width at crest level, hard palate level, horizontal bone loss, interdental cusp width and inter-root apex were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-WhitneyU-tests. Kruskal-Wallis tests and pairwise comparisons were used to detect the significance of differences among the inter-premolar and inter-molar widths. Results:CBCT data revealed significant changes in all transverse dental and alveolar dimensions. The mean interpremolar alveolar width showed an increase of 2.29 to 3.62 mm at the hard palate level, 3.89 to 4.38 mm at the alveolar crest level, and 9.17 to 10.42 mm at the buccal cusp level. Dental changes in the vertical dimension were not significant. Conclusions:Our findings based on an adult animal model suggest that adjunctive buccal and palatal corticotomy can allow for both skeletal and dental expansion, with the amount of dental expansion exceeding that of skeletal expansion at alveolar crest and hard palate levels by two and three folds, respectively. Therefore, this treatment modality is potential to enhance the outcomes of maxillary expansion in adults.","My Huy Thuc Le,Seng Fong Lau,Norliza Ibrahim,Abu Kasim Noor Hayaty,Zamri Bin Radzi","Buccal corticotomy,Cone-beam computed tomography,Maxillary expansion,Palatal corticotomy,Sheep model."

Two-year survival analysis of twisted wire fixed retainer versus spiral wire and fiber-reinforced composite retainers: a preliminary explorative single-blind randomized clinical trial.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27019825/,"Objective:Traditional retainers (both metal and fiber-reinforced composite [FRC]) have limitations, and a retainer made from more flexible ligature wires might be advantageous. We aimed to compare an experimental design with two traditional retainers. Methods:In this prospective preliminary clinical trial, 150 post-treatment patients were enrolled and randomly divided into three groups of 50 patients each to receive mandibular canine-to-canine retainers made of FRC, flexible spiral wire (FSW), and twisted wire (TW). The patients were monitored monthly. The time at which the first signs of breakage/debonding were detected was recorded. The success rates of the retainers were compared using chi-squared, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional-hazard regression analyses (α = 0.05). Results:In total, 42 patients in the FRC group, 41 in the FSW group, and 45 in the TW group completed the study. The 2-year failure rates were 35.7% in the FRC group, 26.8% in the FSW group, and 17.8% in the TW group. These rates differed insignificantly (chi-squared p = 0.167). According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, failure occurred at 19.95 months in the FRC group, 21.37 months in the FSW group, and 22.36 months in the TW group. The differences between the survival rates in the three groups were not significant (Cox regression p = 0.146). Conclusions:Although the failure rate of the experimental retainer was two times lower than that of the FRC retainer, the difference was not statistically significant.

Three-dimensional finite element analysis of the deformation of the human mandible: a preliminary study from the perspective of orthodontic mini-implant stability.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112947/,"Objective:The aims of this study were to investigate mandibular deformation under clenching and to estimate its effect on the stability of orthodontic mini-implants (OMI). Methods:Three finite element models were constructed using computed tomography (CT) images of 3 adults with different mandibular plane angles (A, low; B, average; and C, high). An OMI was placed between #45 and #46 in each model. Mandibular deformation under premolar and molar clenching was simulated. Comparisons were made between peri-orthodontic mini-implant compressive strain (POMI-CSTN) under clenching and orthodontic traction forces (150 g and 200 g). Results:Three models with different mandibular plane angles demonstrated different functional deformation characteristics. The compressive strains around the OMI were distributed mesiodistally rather than occlusogingivally. In model A, the maximum POMI-CSTN under clenching was observed at the mesial aspect of #46 (1,401.75 microstrain [µE]), and similar maximum POMI-CSTN was observed under a traction force of 150 g (1,415 µE). Conclusions:The maximum POMI-CSTN developed by clenching failed to exceed the normally allowed compressive cortical bone strains; however, additional orthodontic traction force to the OMI may increase POMI-CSTN to compromise OMI stability.","Sun-Hye Baek,Hyun-Suk Cha,Jung-Yul Cha,Yoon-Shik Moon,Sang-Jin Sung","Anatomy,Finite element method,Neuromuscular force,Orthodontic mini-implant,Stability."

Methods:The study participants included 223 unrelated Koreans from the Busan area and 256 unrelated Japanese individuals from the Tokyo metropolitan area. DNA samples were extracted from saliva specimens. Genotyping for rs6504340 and four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been shown to be associated with the timing of first tooth eruption and the number of teeth at 1 year of age (rs10506525, rs1956529, rs9674544, and rs8079702) was performed using TaqMan assays.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the swallowing-induced vertical and horizontal displacements of the HB in subjects with 2 different magnitudes of skeletal Class III malocclusion, by means of real-time, balanced turbo-field-echo (B-TFE) cine-magnetic resonance imaging. Methods:The study population comprised 19 patients with mild skeletal Class III malocclusion, 16 with severe skeletal Class III malocclusion, and 20 with a skeletal Class I relationship. Before the commencement of the study, all subjects underwent cephalometric analysis to identify the nature of skeletal malformations. B-TFE images were obtained for the 4 consecutive stages of deglutition as each patient swallowed 10 mL of water, and the vertical and horizontal displacements of the HB were measured at each stage. Results:At all stages of swallowing, the vertical position of the HB in the severe Class III malocclusion group was significantly lower than those in the mild Class III and Class I malocclusion groups. Similarly, the horizontal displacement of the HB was found to be significantly associated with the severity of malocclusion, i.e., the degree of Class III malocclusion, while the amount of anterior displacement of the HB decreased with an increase in the severity of the Class III deformity.

Methods:The sample comprised 46 nongrowing hyperdivergent adult patients who planned to undergo upper first premolar extraction using lingual retractors. They were divided into three groups, based on the lingual appliance used: the C-lingual retractor (CLR) group (group 1, n = 16) and two antero-posterior lingual retractor (APLR) groups (n = 30, groups 2 and 3). The APLR group was divided by the posterior tube angulation; posterior tube parallel to the occlusal plane (group 2, n = 15) and distally tipped tube (group 3, n = 15). A retrospective clinical investigation of the skeletal, dental, and soft tissue relationships was performed using lateral cephalometric radiographs obtained pretreatment and post en masse retraction of the anterior teeth. Results:All groups achieved significant incisor and canine retraction. The upper posterior teeth did not drift significantly during the retraction period. The APLR group had less angulation change in the anterior dentition, compared to the CLR group. By changing the tube angulation in the APLR, the intrusive force significantly increased in the distally tipped tube of group 3 patients and remarkably reduced the occlusal plane angle. Conclusions:Compared to the CLR, the APLR provides better anterior torque control and canine tipping while achieving bodily translation. Furthermore, changing the tube angulation will affect the amount of incisor intrusion, even in patients with similar palatal vault depth, without the need for additional TSADs.","Kyung-Won Seo,Soon-Yong Kwon,Kyung A Kim,Ki-Ho Park,Seong-Hun Kim,Hyo-Won Ahn,Gerald Nelson","C-lingual retractor,Intrusion,Lingual orthodontics,Mini-implant."

"Effects of different primers on indirect orthodontic bonding: Shear bond strength, color change, and enamel roughness.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30003058/,"Objective:We aimed to performin-vitroevaluation to compare 1) shear bond strength (SBS), adhesive remnant index (ARI), and color change between self-etched and acid-etched primers; 2) the SBS, ARI and color change between direct and indirect bonding; and 3) the enamel roughness (ER) between 12-blade bur and aluminum oxide polisher debonding methods. Methods:Seventy bovine incisors were distributed in seven groups: control (no bonding), direct (DTBX), and 5 indirect bonding (ITBX, IZ350, ISONDHI, ISEP, and ITBXp). Transbond XT Primer was used in the DTBX, ITBX, and ITBXp groups, flow resin Z350 in the IZ350 group, Sondhi in the ISONDHI group, and SEP primer in the ISEP group. SBS, ARI, and ER were evaluated. The adhesive remnant was removed using a low-speed tungsten bur in all groups except the ITBXp, in which an aluminum oxide polisher was used. After coffee staining, color evaluations were performed using a spectrophotometer immediately after staining and prior to bonding. Results:ISONDHI and ISEP showed significantly lower SBS (p< 0.01). DTBX had a greater number of teeth with all the adhesive on the enamel (70%), compared with the indirect bonding groups (0-30%). The ER in the ITBX and ITBXp groups was found to be greater because of both clean-up techniques used. Conclusions:Direct and indirect bonding have similar results and all the primers used show satisfactory adhesion strength. Use of burs and polishers increases the ER, but polishers ensure greater integrity of the initial roughness. Resin tags do not change the color of the teeth.","Mirella Lemos Queiróz Tavares,Carlos Nelson Elias,Lincoln Issamu Nojima","Bonding,Color change,Enamel roughness,Shear strength."
Effect of bite force on orthodontic mini-implants in the molar region: Finite element analysis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24228236/,"Objective:To examine the effect of bite force on the displacement and stress distribution of orthodontic mini-implants (OMIs) in the molar region according to placement site, insertion angle, and loading direction. Methods:Five finite element models were created using micro-computed tomography (microCT) images of the maxilla and mandible. OMIs were placed at one maxillary and two mandibular positions: between the maxillary second premolar and first molar, between the mandibular second premolar and first molar, and between the mandibular first and second molars. The OMIs were inserted at angles of 45° and 90° to the buccal surface of the cortical bone. A bite force of 25 kg was applied to the 10 occlusal contact points of the second premolar, first molar, and second molar. The loading directions were 0°, 5°, and 10° to the long axis of the tooth. Results:With regard to placement site, the displacement and stress were greatest for the OMI placed between the mandibular first molar and second molar, and smallest for the OMI placed between the maxillary second premolar and first molar. In the mandibular molar region, the angled OMI showed slightly less displacement than the OMI placed at 90°. The maximum Von Mises stress increased with the inclination of the loading direction. Conclusions:These results suggest that placement of OMIs between the second premolar and first molar at 45° to the cortical bone reduces the effect of bite force on OMIs.","Hyeon-Jung Lee,Kyung-Sook Lee,Min-Ji Kim,Youn-Sic Chun","Bite force,Finite element analysis,Orthodontic mini-implant,Stability."
Evaluation of growth changes induced by functional appliances in children with Class II malocclusion: Superimposition of lateral cephalograms on stable structures.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32475844/,"Objective:To compare short- and long-term dentoalveolar, skeletal, and rotational changes evaluated by Björk's structural method of superimposition between children with Class II malocclusion treated by functional appliances and untreated matched controls. Methods:Seventy-nine prepubertal or pubertal children (mean age, 11.57 ± 1.40 years) with Class II malocclusion were included. Thirty-four children were treated using an activator with a high-pull headgear (Z-activator), while 28 were treated using an activator without a headgear (E-activator). Seventeen untreated children were included as controls. Lateral cephalograms were obtained before treatment (T1), after functional appliance treatment (T2), and after retention in the postpubertal phase (T3). Changes from T1 to T2 and T1 to T3 were compared between the treated groups and control group using multiple linear regression analysis. Results:Relative to the findings in the control group at T2, the sagittal jaw relationship (subspinale-nasion- pogonion,p< 0.001), maxillary prognathism (sella-nasion-subspinale,p< 0.05), and condylar growth (p< 0.001) exhibited significant improvements in the Z- and E-activator groups, which also showed a significantly increased maxillary incisor retraction (p< 0.001) and decreased overjet (p< 0.001). Only the E-activator group exhibited significant backward rotation of the maxilla at T2 (p< 0.01). The improvements in the sagittal jaw relationship (p< 0.01) and dental relationship (p< 0.001) remained significant at T3. Condylar growth and jaw rotations were not significant at T3.

Autotransplantation: A biological treatment alternative for a patient after traumatic dental injury.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29564222/,"Traumatic dental injury is considered a public dental health problem because of a high childhood incidence, high treatment costs, and prolonged treatment time. Although management guidelines for traumatized teeth have been outlined, tooth loss following trauma is occasionally unavoidable. Here, we describe the successful interdisciplinary management of a traumatized central incisor in an 11-year old boy that was extracted because of a poor prognosis and restored by the autotransplantation of an immature donor tooth into the site. The patient underwent orthodontic treatment in order to close the donor site space and bring the autotransplanted tooth to an ideal position. Postorthodontic treatment radiographs and photographs revealed an esthetic and functional natural tooth replacing the lost tooth. The findings from this case suggest that autotransplantation offers unique advantages as a treatment modality for the restoration of missing teeth, particularly in growing children.","Meenakshi Vishwanath,Nandakumar Janakiraman,Hamed Vaziri,Ravindra Nanda,Flavio Uribe","Autotransplantation,Dental trauma,Growth and development,Orthodontic mini-implant,Transplantation."
Impact of skeletal divergence on oral health-related quality of life and self-reported jaw function.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28523245/,"Objective:To investigate the differences in oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) and self-reported jaw function between patients with hyperdivergent and normodivergent facial types. Methods:Eighty patients with a distinctively hyperdivergent facial type (mandibular plane angle greater than 2 standard deviations, or 42°) and 80 controls were individually matched according to age, sex, ethnicity, and treatment stage. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires such as the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) and Jaw Functional Limitation Scale (JFLS-8). Results:The mean age of the patients was 17.2 ± 4.6 years (range, 12-9 years), with most (65.0%) being female and of New Zealand European origin (91.3%). Individuals with hyperdivergent facial types had higher overall and social domain scores on the OHIP-14 (p< 0.05) than did the ones with normodivergent facial types. However, the intergroup differences in JFLS-8 scores were not significant (p> 0.05). Conclusions:Jaw function appears to be similar in individuals with hyperdivergent and normodivergent facial morphologies.

Comparison of the frictional characteristics of aesthetic orthodontic brackets measured using a modified in vitro technique.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25667915/,"Objective:The coefficients of friction (COFs) of aesthetic ceramic and stainless steel brackets used in conjunction with stainless steel archwires were investigated using a modified linear tribometer and special computer software, and the effects of the bracket slot size (0.018 inches [in] or 0.022 in) and materials (ceramic or metal) on the COF were determined. Methods:Four types of ceramic (one with a stainless steel slot) and one conventional stainless steel bracket were tested with two types of archwire sizes: a 0.017 × 0.025-in wire in the 0.018-in slots and a 0.019 × 0.025-in wire in the 0.022-in slot brackets. For pairwise comparisons between the 0.018-in and 0.022-in slot sizes in the same bracket, an independent sample t-test was used. One-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post-hoc test at the 95% confidence level (α = 0.05) were also used for statistical analyses. Results:There were significant differences between the 0.022-in and 0.018-in slot sizes for the same brand of bracket. ANOVA also showed that both slot size and bracket slot material had significant effects on COF values (p < 0.001). The ceramic bracket with a 0.022-in stainless steel slot showed the lowest mean COF (µ = 0.18), followed by the conventional stainless steel bracket with a 0.022-in slot (µ = 0.21). The monocrystalline alumina ceramic bracket with a 0.018-in slot had the highest COF (µ = 0.85). Conclusions:Brackets with stainless steel slots exhibit lower COFs than ceramic slot brackets.

Cone-beam computed tomography analysis of transverse dental compensation in patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30450328/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to analyze the transverse dental compensation in reference to the maxillary and mandibular basal bones using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and evaluate the correlations between transverse dental compensation and skeletal asymmetry variables in patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry. Methods:Thirty patients with skeletal Class I (control group; 15 men, 15 women) and 30 patients with skeletal Class III with menton deviation (asymmetry group; 16 men, 14 women) were included. Skeletal and dental measurements were acquired from reconstructed CBCT images using OnDemand3D 1.0 software. All measurements were compared between groups and between the deviated and nondeviated sides of the asymmetry group. Correlation coefficients for the association between skeletal and dental measurements were calculated. Results:Differences in the ramus inclination (p< 0.001), maxillary canine and first molar inclinations (p< 0.001), and distances from the canine and first molar cusp tips to the midmaxillary or midmandibular planes (p< 0.01) between the right and left sides were significantly greater in the asymmetry group than in the control group. In the asymmetry group, the ramus inclination difference (p< 0.05) and mandibular canting (p< 0.05) were correlated with the amount of menton deviation. In addition, dental measurements were positively correlated with the amount of menton deviation (p< 0.05).

Methods:Imaging was performed using a CBCT scanner with a 0.292-mm voxel size and 12-bit grayscale. The CBCT-based length measurements were compared with direct measurements of 94 subsequently extracted premolars without metal restorations using the paired t-test. Furthermore, the crown and root lengths of incisors, canines, and premolars in 62 Korean patients with malocclusions were measured using CBCT, and Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the relationship between the crown and root length measurements of each tooth type. Results:The differences between the CBCT-based and direct measurements of the extracted premolars were not significant, with 95% limits of agreement of -0.90 to 0.90 mm for crown length and -1.23 to 1.18 mm for root length. Weak positive correlations between the crown and root length measurements were observed for the mandibular canine and premolars. Conclusions:The CBCT-based measurements showed a wider range of limits of agreements for root length than for crown length.

Histologic effects of intentional-socket-assisted orthodontic movement in rabbits.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112952/,"Objective:This study aimed to evaluate the effect of an intentionally created socket on bone remodeling with orthodontic tooth movement in rabbits. Methods:Eighteen male rabbits weighing 3.8 - 4.25 kg were used. An 8-mm deep and 2-mm wide socket was drilled in the bone 1 mm mesial to the right mandibular first premolar. The left first premolar was extracted to serve as an extraction socket. A traction force of 100 cN was applied to the right first premolar and left second premolar. Sections were obtained at the middle third of the moving tooth for both the drilled and extraction sockets and evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical analyses. The amount of tooth movement and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cell count were compared between the 2 groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results:At week 2, the distance of tooth movement was significantly higher in the intentional socket group (p < 0.05) than in the extraction socket group. The number of TRAP-positive cells decreased in week 2 but increased in week 3 (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences between the groups. Furthermore, results of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β staining revealed no significant differences. Conclusions:The intentional socket group showed greater distance of tooth movement than did the extraction socket group at week 2. Osteoclast counts and results of immunohistochemical analyses suggested elevated bone remodeling in both the groups. Thus, osteotomy may be an effective modality for enhancing tooth movement in orthodontic treatment.","Ji-Yeon Yu,Won Lee,Jae Hyun Park,Mohamed Bayome,Yong Kim,Yoon-Ah Kook","Accelerated tooth movement,Bone remodeling,Intentional socket."

Methods:A photograph of a woman's smile was digitally altered using a software image editing program. The alterations involved gingival margin height, crown width and length, incisal plane canting, and dental midline of the maxillary anterior teeth. Three groups of raters (orthodontically treated laypersons, non-treated laypersons, and dentists) evaluated the original and altered images using a visual analog scale. Results:The threshold for detecting changes in maxillary central incisor gingival margin height among laypersons was 1.5 mm; the threshold of dentists, who were more perceptive, was 1.0 mm. For maxillary lateral incisor crown width and height, the threshold of all three groups was 3.0 mm. Canting of the incisal plane was perceived when the canting was 3.0 mm among non-treated laypersons, 2.0 mm among treated laypersons, and 1.0 mm among dentists. Non-treated laypersons could not perceive dental midline shifts; however, treated laypersons and dentists perceived them when the shift was ≥ 3.0 mm. Conclusions:Laypersons with and without orthodontic treatment experience and dentists have different perceptions of smile esthetics. Orthodontically treated laypersons were more critical than non-treated laypersons regarding incisal plane canting and dental midline shifts. Based on these findings, it is suggested that orthodontic treatment experience improved the esthetic perceptions of laypersons.","Seong-Mu An,Sun-Young Choi,Young-Wook Chung,Tae-Ho Jang,Kyung-Hwa Kang","Computerized image alteration,Esthetics,Photography."

Methods:Twenty-four Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups. Mesial forces of 0, 50, or 100 g were applied to the maxillary first molar of the rats in each group for 14 days by activating nickel-titanium closed-coil springs. One-half of the rats receiving each of these treatments also received injections of 200 µL fangchinoline every 2 days. Finally, movement of the maxillary first molars was measured using digitized radiographs. The molars were extracted and the surfaces of the root resorption craters were recorded using a scanning electron microscope. The distance the molars moved and resorptionarea ratio was measured, and results were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA tests. Results:There were no statistical differences in the distances the first molars moved under 50 or 100 g force, regardless of treatment with fangchinoline. However, the resorption area ratios were significantly smaller in those rats that were treated with both tension and fangchinoline than in those rats treated by tension alone. Conclusions:Fangchinoline reduced the resorption area ratio in rats and is therefore an important means of alleviating root resorption.","Xingfu Bao,Min Hu,Yi Zhang,Ferdinand Machibya,Ying Zhang,Huan Jiang,Dongsheng Yu","Root resorption,SEM,Tooth movement."

The intersecond molar width increased slightly (0.1 mm, p > 0.05) and the intercanine, interfirst premolar, intersecond premolar, and interfirst molar widths increased significantly (2.2 mm, p < 0.01; 2.2 mm, p < 0.05; 1.9 mm, p < 0.01; 2.0 mm, p < 0.01; respectively). Conclusions:Nonextraction treatment with OMI anchorage for Class II division 1 malocclusions could retract the whole maxillary dentition to achieve a Class I canine and molar relationship without a change in the vertical position of the teeth; however, the second molars were significantly extruded. Simultaneously, the maxillary arch was shown to be expanded with distal-in rotation of the molars.","Dler Ali,Hnd Mohammed,Seung-Hwan Koo,Kyung-Hwa Kang,Sang-Cheol Kim","Class II division 1 malocclusion,Mini-implant anchorage,Nonextraction treatment,Tooth movement."
Evaluation of alveolar bone loss following rapid maxillary expansion using cone-beam computed tomography.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23671833/,"Objective:To evaluate the changes in cortical bone thickness, alveolar bone height, and the incidence of dehiscence and fenestration in the surrounding alveolar bone of posterior teeth after rapid maxillary expansion (RME) treatment using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods:The CBCT records of 20 subjects (9 boys, mean age: 13.97 ± 1.17 years; 11 girls, mean age: 13.53 ± 2.12 year) that underwent RME were selected from the archives. CBCT scans had been taken before (T1) and after (T2) the RME. Moreover, 10 of the subjects had 6-month retention (T3) records. We used the CBCT data to evaluate the buccal and palatal aspects of the canines, first and second premolars, and the first molars at 3 vertical levels. The cortical bone thickness and alveolar bone height at T1 and T2 were evaluated with the paired-samples t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Repeated measure ANOVA or the Friedman test was used to evaluate the statistical significance at T1, T2, and T3. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results:The buccal cortical bone thickness decreased gradually from baseline to the end of the retention period. After expansion, the buccal alveolar bone height was reduced significantly; however, this change was not statistically significant after the 6-month retention period. During the course of the treatment, the incidence of dehiscence and fenestration increased and decreased, respectively. Conclusions:RME may have detrimental effects on the supporting alveolar bone, since the thickness and height of the buccal alveolar bone decreased during the retention period.","Asli Baysal,Tancan Uysal,Ilknur Veli,Torun Ozer,Irfan Karadede,Seyit Hekimoglu","Cone-beam computed tomography,Periodontium,Rapid maxillary expansion."
Effects of demineralizaton-inhibition procedures on the bond strength of brackets bonded to demineralized enamel surface.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112927/,"Objective:To study and compare the effects of different demineralization-inhibition methods on the shear bond strength (SBS) and fracture mode of an adhesive used to bond orthodontic brackets to demineralized enamel surfaces. Methods:Eighty freshly extracted, human maxillary premolars were divided into 4 equal groups and demineralized over the course of 21 days. Brackets were bonded to the demineralized enamel of teeth in Group 1. In Group 2, bonding was performed following resin infiltration (ICON®, DMG, Hamburg, Germany). Before bonding, pre-treatment with acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) or solutions containing casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate with 2% neutral sodium fluoride (CPP-ACP/wF) was performed in Groups 3 and 4, respectively. The SBS values of the brackets were measured and recorded following mechanical shearing of the bracket from the tooth surface. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores were determined after the brackets failed. Statistical comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA, Tukey's post-tests, and G-tests. Results:Significant differences were found in some of the intergroup comparisons of the SBS values (F = 39.287, p < 0.001). No significant differences were found between the values for the APF-gel and control groups, whereas significantly higher SBS values were recorded for the resin-infiltrated and CPP-ACP/wF-treated groups. The ARI scores were also significantly different among the 4 groups (p < 0.001). Conclusions:Tooth surfaces exposed to resin infiltration and CPP-ACP/wF application showed higher debonding forces than the untreated, demineralized surfaces.","Abdullah Ekizer,Yahya Orcun Zorba,Tancan Uysal,Servet Ayrikcila","Bonding,Bracket,Decalcification,Oral hygiene."
Orthodontic and surgical management of cleidocranial dysplasia.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24228240/,"Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), an autosomal dominant disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 1,000,000 individuals, is mainly caused by mutations in Runx2, a gene required for osteoblastic differentiation. It is generally characterized by hypoplastic clavicles, narrow thorax, and delayed or absent fontanel closure. Importantly, its orofacial manifestations, including midfacial hypoplasia, retained primary teeth, and impacted permanent and supernumerary teeth, severely impede the well-being of affected individuals. Successful treatment of the orofacial problems requires the combined efforts of dental specialists. However, only a few successfully treated cases have been reported because of the rarity of CCD and complexity of the treatment. This article presents the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) treatment protocol for the dentofacial manifestations of CCD based on two treated and 17 diagnosed cases. The records of two patients with CCD who had been treated at the UCSF School of Dentistry and the treatment options reported in the literature were reviewed. The UCSF treatment protocol produced a successful case and a partially successful one (inadequate oral hygiene in the retention stage resulted in decay and loss of teeth). It provides general guidelines for successfully treating the orofacial manifestations of CCD.","Tina Keun Nan Park,Karin Vargervik,Snehlata Oberoi","Advancement,Craniofacial anomalies,Impaction,Tooth impaction."
The effect of casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate on the in vitro shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23504444/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) on the shear bond strength (SBS) of brackets bonded to non-demineralized teeth with either phosphoric acid etching or self-etching primer. Methods:Sixty human premolars were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (n = 15 each): phosphoric acid etching (group 1); self-etching primer (group 2); CPP-ACP for 2 weeks + phosphoric acid etching (group 3), and CPP-ACP for 2 weeks + self-etching primer (group 4). After bonding of the maxillary premolar metal brackets, specimens were subjected to shear forces in a testing machine. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe etching patterns on the enamel surfaces of all teeth. A 2-way analysis of variance was used to test for effects of CPP-ACP and etching system on SBS. Results:Significantly higher mean SBSs were observed in groups subjected to phosphoric acid etching (i.e., groups 1 and 3; p < 0.05). On the other hand, SBSs did not appear to be influenced by CPP-ACP (i.e., groups 3 and 4; p > 0.05). We observed a uniform and clear etched pattern on the enamel surface of the phosphoric acid etching groups.

Fluoride penetration from three orthodontic adhesives: an experimental study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23502591/,"Objective:To examine the prophylactic potential of 3 orthodontic bonding adhesives: Fuji Ortho SC, Illuminate, and Resilience. Methods:Thirty-six Wistar Wag rats were randomly divided into 4 groups consisting of 9 rats each. One of the groups received no treatment and was used as a control. In the other groups, individual bands coated with one of the 3 adhesives were cemented to the lower incisors. Enamel samples were obtained after 6 and 12 weeks and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive spectrometry. Results:Six weeks after band cementation, no fluoride was found in the enamel of the lower incisors. After 12 weeks, there was no fluoride in the enamel of teeth coated with the Resilience composite. However, in the case of the Illuminate composite and the resin-modified glass ionomer Fuji Ortho SC cement, the depth of fluoride penetration reached 2 µm and 4.8 - 5.7 µm, respectively. Conclusions:Fluoride ions from orthodontic adhesives can be incorporated into the surface layer of the enamel. Orthodontists may apply orthodontic adhesives, such as the Fuji Ortho SC, to reduce the occurrence of caries during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances.","Leopold Wagner,Magdalena Szepietowska","Biomaterials science,Decalcification,Fixed appliances,Orthodontics."
Maxillary expansion with the memory screw: a preliminary investigation.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112935/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a newly developed rapid maxillary expansion screw-the memory screw-over 6 months. Methods:Five subjects, aged between 11.7 and 13.75 years, were enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent placement of a maxillary expansion appliance containing superelastic nickel-titanium open-coil springs in its screw bed. The parents of the patients and/or the patients themselves were instructed to activate the expansion screw by 2 quarter-turns 3 times a day (morning, midday, and evening; 6 quarter-turns a day). The mean expansion period was 7.52 ± 1.04 days. Dentoskeletal effects of the procedure, including dentoalveolar inclination, were evaluated. Measurements of all the parameters were repeated after 6 months of retention in order to check for relapse. Results:Sella-Nasion-A point (SNA) and Sella-Nasion/Gonion-Menton angles increased, and Sella-Nasion-B point (SNB) angle decreased in all the subjects during the expansion phase. However, they approximated to the initial values at the end of 6 months. On the other hand, the increments in maxillary apical base (Mxr-Mxl) and intermolar widths was quite stable. As expected, some amount of dentoalveolar tipping was observed. Conclusions:The newly developed memory expansion screw offers advantages of both rapid and slow expansion procedures. It widens the midpalatal suture and expands the maxilla with relatively lighter forces and within a short time. In addition, the resultant increments in the maxillary apical base and intermolar width remained quite stable even after 6 months of retention.","Koray Halicioğlu,Ali Kiki,Ibrahim Yavuz","Appliances,Cephalometrics,Expansion,Retention and stability."
"Unilateral maxillary central incisor root resorption after orthodontic treatment for Angle Class II, division 1 malocclusion with significant maxillary midline deviation: A possible correlation with root proximity to the incisive canal.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32475849/,"Root resorption can be caused by several factors, including contact with the cortical bone. Here we report a case involving a 21-year-old female with Angle Class II, division 1 malocclusion who exhibited significant root resorption in the maxillary right central incisor after orthodontic treatment. The patient presented with significant left-sided deviation of the maxillary incisors due to lingual dislocation of the left lateral incisor and a Class II molar relationship. Cephalometric analysis demonstrated a Class I skeletal relationship (A pointnasion-B point, 2.5°) and proclined maxillary anterior teeth (upper incisor to sella-nasion plane angle, 113.4°). The primary treatment objectives were the achievement of stable occlusion with midline agreement between the maxillary and mandibular dentitions and appropriate maxillary anterior tooth axes and molar relationship. A panoramic radiograph obtained after active treatment showed significant root resorption in the maxillary right central incisor; therefore, we performed cone-beam computed tomography, which confirmed root resorption along the cortical bone around the incisive canal. The findings from this case, where different degrees of root resorption were observed despite comparable degrees of orthodontic movement in the bilateral maxillary central incisors, suggest that the incisive canal could be an inducing factor for root resorption. However, further investigation is necessary to confirm this assumption.","Toshihiro Imamura,Shunsuke Uesugi,Takashi Ono","Computed tomography,Digital models,Incisive canal,Root resorption."
Evaluation of the palatal soft tissue thickness by cone-beam computed tomography.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23323243/,"Objective:The purposes of this study were to measure the palatal soft tissue thickness at popular placement sites of temporary anchorage devices (TADs) by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and evaluate the age, gender, and positional differences in this parameter. Methods:The study sample consisted of 23 children (10 boys and 13 girls; mean age, 10.87 ± 1.24 years; range, 6.7 to 12.6 years) and 27 adults (14 men and 13 women; mean age, 21.35 ± 1.14 years; range, 20.0 to 23.8 years). Nine mediolateral and nine anteroposterior intersecting reference lines were drawn on CBCT scans of the 50 subjects, and the resultant measurement areas were designated according to their mediolateral (i.e., lateral, medial, and sutural) and anteroposterior (i.e., anterior, middle, and posterior) positions. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to analyze intragroup and intergroup differences. Results:No significant age and gender differences were found (p = 0.309 and 0.124, respectively). Further, no significant anteroposterior change was observed (p = 0.350). However, the lateral area presented the thickest soft tissue whereas the sutural area had the thinnest soft tissue (p < 0.001).

Three-dimensional assessment of the temporomandibular joint and mandibular dimensions after early correction of the maxillary arch form in patients with Class II division 1 or division 2 malocclusion.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26023540/,"Objective:This study aimed to assess three-dimensional changes in the temporomandibular joint positions and mandibular dimensions after correction of dental factors restricting mandibular growth in patients with Class II division 1 or division 2 malocclusion in the pubertal growth period. Methods:This prospective clinical study included 14 patients each with Class II division 1 (group I) and Class II division 2 (group II) malocclusions. The quad-helix was used for maxillary expansion, while utility arches were used for intrusion (group I) or protrusion and intrusion (group II) of the maxillary incisors. After approximately 2 months of treatment, an adequate maxillary arch width and acceptable maxillary incisor inclination were obtained. The patients were followed for an average of 6 months. Intraoral and extraoral photographs, plaster models, and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were obtained before and after treatment. Lateral cephalometric and temporomandibular joint measurements were made from the CBCT images. Results:The mandibular dimensions increased in both groups, although mandibular positional changes were also found in group II. There were no differences in the condylar position within the mandibular fossa or the condylar dimensions. The mandibular fossa depth and condylar positions were symmetrical at treatment initiation and completion. Conclusions:Class II malocclusion can be partially corrected by achieving an ideal maxillary arch form, particularly in patients with Class II division 2 malocclusion. Restrictions of the mandible in the transverse or sagittal plane do not affect the temporomandibular joint positions in these patients because of the high adaptability of this joint.","Hande Gorucu Coskuner,Semra Ciger","Class II,Computed tomography,Early treatment,Temporomandibular joint."
Nonsurgical correction of a severe anterior deep overbite accompanied by a gummy smile and posterior scissor bite using a miniscrew-assisted straight-wire technique in an adult high-angle case.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27478802/,"In the present report, we describe the successful use of miniscrews to achieve vertical control in combination with the conventional sliding MBT™ straight-wire technique for the treatment of a 26-year-old Chinese woman with a very high mandibular plane angle, deep overbite, retrognathic mandible with backward rotation, prognathic maxilla, and gummy smile. The patient exhibited skeletal Class II malocclusion. Orthodontic miniscrews were placed in the maxillary anterior and posterior segments to provide rigid anchorage and vertical control through intrusion of the incisors and molars. Intrusion and torque control of the maxillary incisors relieved the deep overbite and corrected the gummy smile, while intrusion of the maxillary molars aided in counterclockwise rotation of the mandibular plane, which consequently resulted in an improved facial profile. After 3.5 years of retention, we observed a stable, well-aligned dentition with ideal intercuspation and more harmonious facial contours. Thus, we were able to achieve a satisfactory occlusion, a significantly improved facial profile, and an attractive smile for this patient. The findings from this case suggest that nonsurgical correction using miniscrew anchorage is an effective approach for camouflage treatment of high-angle cases with skeletal Class II malocclusion.","Xue-Dong Wang,Jie-Ni Zhang,Da-Wei Liu,Fei-Fei Lei,Yan-Heng Zhou","Gummy smile,High mandibular plane angle,Orthodontic miniscrew,Vertical control."
A case of severe mandibular retrognathism with bilateral condylar deformities treated with Le Fort I osteotomy and two advancement genioplasty procedures.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27896214/,"We report a case involving a young female patient with severe mandibular retrognathism accompanied by mandibular condylar deformity that was effectively treated with Le Fort I osteotomy and two genioplasty procedures. At 9 years and 9 months of age, she was diagnosed with Angle Class III malocclusion, a skeletal Class II jaw relationship, an anterior crossbite, congenital absence of some teeth, and a left-sided cleft lip and palate. Although the anterior crossbite and narrow maxillary arch were corrected by interceptive orthodontic treatment, severe mandibular hypogrowth resulted in unexpectedly severe mandibular retrognathism after growth completion. Moreover, bilateral condylar deformities were observed, and we suspected progressive condylar resorption (PCR). There was a high risk of further condylar resorption with mandibular advancement surgery; therefore, Le Fort I osteotomy with two genioplasty procedures was performed to achieve counterclockwise rotation of the mandible and avoid ingravescence of the condylar deformities. The total duration of active treatment was 42 months. The maxilla was impacted by 7.0 mm and 5.0 mm in the incisor and molar regions, respectively, while the pogonion was advanced by 18.0 mm. This significantly resolved both skeletal disharmony and malocclusion. Furthermore, the hyoid bone was advanced, the pharyngeal airway space was increased, and the morphology of the mandibular condyle was maintained. At the 30-month follow-up examination, the patient exhibited a satisfactory facial profile. The findings from our case suggest that severe mandibular retrognathism with condylar deformities can be effectively treated without surgical mandibular advancement, thus decreasing the risk of PCR.","Masahiro Nakamura,Takeshi Yanagita,Tatsushi Matsumura,Takashi Yamashiro,Seiji Iida,Hiroshi Kamioka","Condylar deformity,Genioplasty,Orthognathic surgery,Severe mandibular retrognathism."
Skeletal myogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stromal cells isolated from orthodontically extracted premolars.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23173118/,"Objective:To investigate the stem cell-like characteristics of human periodontal ligament (PDL) stromal cells outgrown from orthodontically extracted premolars and to evaluate the potential for myogenic differentiation. Methods:PDL stromal cells were obtained from extracted premolars by using the outgrowth method. Cell morphological features, self-replication capability, and the presence of cell-surface markers, along with osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation, were confirmed. In addition, myogenic differentiation was induced by the use of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) for DNA demethylation. Results:PDL stromal cells showed growth patterns and morphological features similar to those of fibroblasts. In contrast, the proliferation rates of premolar PDL stromal cells were similar to those of bone marrow and adipogenic stem cells. PDL stromal cells expressed surface markers of human mesenchymal stem cells (i.e., CD90 and CD105), but not those of hematopoietic stem cells (i.e., CD31 and CD34). PDL stromal cells were differentiated into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. Myotube structures were induced in PDL stromal cells after 5-Aza pretreatment, but not in the absence of 5-Aza pretreatment.

Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 429 orthodontic mini-screw placements in 286 patients (102 in men and 327 in women) between 2005 and 2010 at private practice. Age, gender, mini-screw length, and insertion site were cross-tabulated against the insertion methods. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was performed to compare the success rates of the 2 insertion methods. Results:The motor-driven method was used for 228 mini-screws and the manual method for the remaining 201 mini-screws. The success rates were similar in both men and women irrespective of the insertion method used. With respect to mini-screw length, no difference in success rates was found between motor and hand drivers for the 6-mm-long mini-screws (68.1% and 69.5% with the engine driver and hand driver, respectively). However, the 8-mm-long mini-screws exhibited significantly higher success rates (90.4%, p < 0.01) than did the 6-mm-long mini-screws when placed with the engine driver. The overall success rate was also significantly higher in the maxilla (p < 0.05) when the engine driver was used.

Integrated three-dimensional digital assessment of accuracy of anterior tooth movement using clear aligners.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26629473/,"Objective:To assess the accuracy of anterior tooth movement using clear aligners in integrated three-dimensional digital models. Methods:Cone-beam computed tomography was performed before and after treatment with clear aligners in 32 patients. Plaster casts were laser-scanned for virtual setup and aligner fabrication. Differences in predicted and achieved root and crown positions of anterior teeth were compared on superimposed maxillofacial digital images and virtual models and analyzed by Student's t-test. Results:The mean discrepancies in maxillary and mandibular crown positions were 0.376 ± 0.041 mm and 0.398 ± 0.037 mm, respectively. Maxillary and mandibular root positions differed by 2.062 ± 0.128 mm and 1.941 ± 0.154 mm, respectively. Conclusions:Crowns but not roots of anterior teeth can be moved to designated positions using clear aligners, because these appliances cause tooth movement by tilting motion.","Xiao-Juan Zhang,Li He,Hong-Ming Guo,Jie Tian,Yu-Xing Bai,Song Li","Clear aligners,Cone-beam computed tomography,Registration."
Role of interleukin-6 in orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption in humans.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24396739/,"Objective:To determine the interleukin (IL)-6 levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of patients with severe root resorption after orthodontic treatment and investigate the effects of different static compressive forces (CFs) on IL-6 production by human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells and the influence of IL-6 on osteoclastic activation from human osteoclastic precursor (hOCP) cells in vitro. Methods:IL-6 levels in GCF samples collected from 20 patients (15 and 5 subjects without and with radiographic evidence of severe root resorption, respectively) who had undergone orthodontic treatment were measured by ELISA. The levels of IL-6 mRNA in hPDL cells and IL-6 protein in conditioned medium after the application of different uniform CFs (0, 1.0, 2.0, or 4.0 g/cm(2) for up to 72 h) were measured by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Finally, the influence of IL-6 on mature osteoclasts was investigated by using hOCP cells on dentin slices in a pit-formation assay. Results:Clinically, the IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the resorption group than in the control group. In vitro, IL-6 mRNA expression significantly increased with increasing CF. IL-6 protein secretion also increased in a time- and magnitude-dependent manner. Resorbed areas on dentin slices were significantly greater in the recombinant human IL-6-treated group and group cultured in hPDL cell-conditioned medium with CF application (4.0 g/cm(2)) than in the group cultured in hPDL cell-conditioned medium without CF application. Conclusions:IL-6 may play an important role in inducing or facilitating orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption.","Ryuichi Kunii,Masaru Yamaguchi,Yasuhiro Tanimoto,Masaki Asano,Kunihiko Yamada,Takemi Goseki,Kazutaka Kasai","Interleukin-6,Orthodontic force,Osteo/odontoclastogenesis,Root resorption."
Prevalence of malocclusion and its relationship with caries among school children aged 11 - 15 years in southern India.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23503064/,"Objective:To assess the prevalence of malocclusion and its relationship with dental caries among school children in southern India. Methods:This cross-sectional study included 1,800 students aged 11 - 15 years whose Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI) and dentition status were recorded and analyzed. The chi-square test, ANOVA, and Spearman's correlation tests were carried out. Results:The mean DAI score ± the standard deviation was 18.61 ± 6.1. Approximately 85% of the students (83.0% males, 86.8% females) had DAI scores of < 26 and were classified as not requiring orthodontic treatment. One tenth of the sample had mean DAI scores between 26 - 30 (indicating definite malocclusion and elective treatment), while about 3% had mean scores between 31 - 35 (indicating severe malocclusion and treatment desirability). Only 29 children (1.6%; 16 boys, 13 girls) had a DAI score of > 35, which suggested very severe or handicapping malocclusion requiring mandatory treatment. The mean decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) was 2.28 ± 1.47. A DMFT of > 0 was observed in 91.8% of the study subjects. Children with a DAI score of > 35 were found to have significantly (p < 0.001) higher caries experience as compared to other children. Moreover, the DAI scores showed a significant correlation with the mean DMFT scores (r = 0.368, p < 0.05).

Orthodontic bonding to acid- or laser-etched prebleached enamel.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814709/,"Objective:Bonding forces of brackets to enamel surfaces may be affected by the procedures used for bleaching and enamel etching. The aim of this study was to investigate the bonding strength of orthodontic brackets to laser-etched surfaces of bleached teeth. Methods:In a nonbleached control group, acid etching (group A) or Er:YAG laser application (group B) was performed prior to bracket bonding (n = 13 in each group). Similar surface treatments were performed at 1 day (groups C and D; n = 13 in each subgroup) or at 3 weeks (groups E and F; n = 13 in each subgroup) after 38% hydrogen peroxide bleaching in another set of teeth. The specimens were debonded after thermocycling. Results:Laser etching of bleached teeth resulted in clinically unacceptable low bonding strength. In the case of acid-etched teeth, waiting for 3 weeks before attachment of brackets to the bleached surfaces resulted in similar, but not identical, bond strength values as those obtained with nonbleached surfaces. However, in the laser-etched groups, the bonding strength after 3 weeks was the same as that for the nonbleached group. Conclusions:When teeth bleached with 38% hydrogen peroxide are meant to be bonded immediately, acid etching is preferable.","Fulya Ozdemir,Umut Cakan,Nese Gonul,Derya Germec Cakan","Bonding,Decalcification,Laser."

Methods:The horizontal and sagittal plane intersection points were identified for middle-third facial analysis in 40 patients in the MD or normal (N) groups. MPR images acquired parallel to each horizontal plane were used for length and angular measurements. Results:A comparison of the MD and N groups revealed significant differences in the zygoma prominence among female patients. The convex zygomatic area in the N group was larger than that in the MD group, and the inferior part of the midface in the N group was smaller than that in the MD group for both male and female patients. A significant difference was observed in the concave middle maxillary area among male patients. Conclusions:This study was conducted to demonstrate the difference between MD and normal face through MPR images derived from CBCT. Male patients in the MD group had a more flattened face than did those in the N group. Female patients in the MD group showed a concave-shaped lower section of the zygoma, which tended to have more severe MD. These findings indicate that orthognathic surgery to improve skeletal discrepancy requires different approaches in male and female patients.","Bomi Kim,Hyung-Chul Lee,Seong-Hun Kim,Yongil Kim,Woosung Son,Seong Sik Kim","Class III malocclusion,Cone-beam computed tomography,Midface deficiency,Multiplanar-reconstructed image."
Compressive force regulates ephrinB2 and EphB4 in osteoblasts and osteoclasts contributing to alveolar bone resorption during experimental tooth movement.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25473648/,"Objective:To investigate the involvement of ephrinB2 in periodontal tissue remodeling in compression areas during orthodontic tooth movement and the effects of compressive force on EphB4 and ephrinB2 expression in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Methods:A rat model of experimental tooth movement was established to examine the histological changes and the localization of ephrinB2 in compressed periodontal tissues during experimental tooth movement. RAW264.7 cells and ST2 cells, used as precursor cells of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, respectively, were subjected to compressive force in vitro. The gene expression of EphB4 and ephrinB2, as well as bone-associated factors including Runx2, Sp7, NFATc1, and calcitonin receptor, were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results:Histological examination of the compression areas of alveolar bone from experimental rats showed that osteoclastogenic activities were promoted while osteogenic activities were inhibited. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ephrinB2 was strongly expressed in osteoclasts in these areas. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that mRNA levels of NFATc1, calcitonin receptor, and ephrinB2 were increased significantly in compressed RAW264.7 cells, and the expression of ephrinB2, EphB4, Sp7, and Runx2 was decreased significantly in compressed ST2 cells. Conclusions:Our results indicate that compressive force can regulate EphB4 and ephrinB2 expression in osteoblasts and osteoclasts, which might contribute to alveolar bone resorption in compression areas during orthodontic tooth movement.","Jianhua Hou,Yanze Chen,Xiuping Meng,Ce Shi,Chen Li,Yuanping Chen,Hongchen Sun","Bone biology,Cell/molecular biology,EphB4,EphrinB2,Tooth movement."
Effects of contamination by either blood or a hemostatic agent on the shear bond strength of orthodontic buttons.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23671834/,"Objective:To evaluate the effects of contamination by either blood or a hemostatic agent on the shear bond strength (SBS) of orthodontic buttons. Methods:We used 45 freshly extracted, non-carious, impacted third molars that were divided into 3 groups of 15. Each tooth was etched with 37% phosphoric acid gel for 30 s. Human blood or the blood stopper agent was applied to the tooth surface in groups I and II, respectively. Group III teeth were untreated (controls). Orthodontic buttons were bonded to the teeth using light-curing composite resin. After bonding, the SBS of the button was determined using a Universal testing machine. Any adhesive remaining after debonding was assessed and scored according to the modified adhesive remnant index (ARI). ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's test was used to determine significant differences in SBS and Fisher's exact test, to determine significant differences in ARI scores among groups. Results:ANOVA indicated a significant difference between groups (p < 0.001). The highest SBS values were measured in group III (10.73 ± 0.96 MPa). The SBS values for teeth in groups I and II were significantly lower than that of group III (p < 0.001). The lowest SBS values were observed in group I teeth (4.17 ± 1.11 MPa) (p < 0.001). Conclusions:Contamination of tooth surfaces with either blood or hemostatic agent significantly decreased the SBS of orthodontic buttons. When the contamination risk is high, it is recommended to use the blood stopper agent when bonding orthodontic buttons on impacted teeth.","Ahmet Yalçın Güngör,Huseyin Alkis,Hakan Turkkahraman","Adhesive,Blood stopper agent,Bonding,Soft tissue surgery."
Comparison of condylar displacement between three biotypological facial groups by using mounted models and a mandibular position indicator.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25473647/,"Objective:Facial-type-associated variations in diagnostic features have several implications in orthodontics. For example, in hyperdivergent craniofacial types, growth imbalances are compensated by displacement of the condyle. When diagnosis and treatment planning involves centric relation (CR), detailed knowledge of the condylar position is desirable. The present study aimed to measure condylar displacement (CD) between CR and maximum intercuspation in three facial types of an asymptomatic orthodontic population. Methods:The study was conducted in 108 patients classified into three groups of 36 individuals each (27 women and 9 men; mean age, 20.5 years), based on the following facial patterns: hyperdivergent, hypodivergent, and intermediate. To quantify CD along the horizontal and vertical axes, the condylar position was analyzed using mounted casts on a semi-adjustable articulator and a mandibular position indicator. The Student t-test was used to compare CD between the groups. Results:Vertical displacement was found to be significantly different between the hyperdivergent and hypodivergent groups (p < 0.0002) and between the hyperdivergent and intermediate groups (p < 0.0006). The differences in horizontal displacement were not significant between the groups. In each group, vertical CD was more evident than horizontal displacement was. Conclusions:All facial types, especially the hyperdivergent type, carried a significantly high risk of CD. Therefore, the possibility of CD should be carefully evaluated and considered in the assessment of all orthodontic cases in order to accurately assess jaw relationships and avoid possible misdiagnosis.","Maria João Ponces,José Pedro Tavares,Jorge Dias Lopes,Afonso Pinhão Ferreira","Centric relation,Cephalometrics,Condylar displacement,Growth evaluation,Maximum intercuspation."

The treatment modalities involved the use of magnetic bite-blocks (MBBs) or rapid molar intruders (RMIs) applied with posterior bite-blocks. Methods:Fifteen consecutive patients with a mean age of 11.2 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.6) years and a mean open bite of -3.9 mm were treated with MBBs. Another 15 consecutive patients with a mean age of 10.9 (SD = 1.8) years and a mean open bite of -3.8 mm were treated with RMIs applied on bite-blocks. Cephalometric radiographs were obtained before (T1) and immediately after appliance removal (T2). The treatments lasted four months, during which the appliances were cemented to the teeth. The morphological changes were measured in each group and compared using logistic regression analysis. Results:The MBB group exhibited significantly greater decreases in SNA angle, ANB angle, overjet, and maxillary incisor angle (p < 0.05). The MBBs induced greater effects on the maxilla and maxillary dentition. The MBBs restrained maxillary forward growth and retracted the maxillary incisors more effectively than did the RMIs. Consequently, changes in the intermaxillary relationships and overjets were more distinct in the MBB group. Conclusions:The anteroposterior differences between the appliances suggest that MBBs should be preferred for the treatment of patients with Class II open bites and maxillary incisor protrusions.","Mhd Hassan Albogha,Ichiro Takahashi,Mhd Naser Sawan","Anterior open bite,Early treatment,Magnets,Rapid molar intruder."

To correct a prognathic mandible, facial asymmetry, flat occlusal plane angle, labioversion of the maxillary central incisors, and concavity of the facial profile, bimaxillary orthognathic surgery was planned. After preoperative orthodontic treatment, surgical planning based on the concept of 6 DOF was performed on a surgical treatment objective drawing, and a Jeon's model surgery chart (JMSC) was prepared.

Methods:CBCT images (n = 142) of adult patients (20-45 years) were classified into hypodivergent, normodivergent, and hyperdivergent groups on the basis of linear and angular S-N/Go-Me measurements. The cortical bone densities (in Hounsfield units) at maxillary and mandibular interdental sites from the distal aspect of the canine to the mesial aspect of the second molar were measured on the images. Results:On the maxillary buccal side, female subjects in the hyperdivergent group showed significantly decreased bone density, while in the posterior region, male subjects in the hyperdivergent group displayed significantly decreased bone density when compared with corresponding subjects in the other groups (p<0.001). Furthermore, the subjects in the hyperdivergent group had significantly lower bone densities on the mandibular buccal side than hypodivergent subjects. The maxillary palatal bone density did not differ significantly among groups, but female subjects showed significantly denser palatal cortical bone. No significant difference in bone density was found between the palatal and buccal sides in the maxillary premolar region. Overall, the palatal cortical bone was denser anteriorly and buccal cortical bone was denser posteriorly. Conclusion:Adults with the hyperdivergent facial type tend to have less-dense buccal cortical bone in the maxillary and mandibular alveolar processes.

Methods:Fifty patients who underwent both LCR and CBCT were selected as subjects. CBCT was reoriented in 3 different methods and the measuring-points were projected onto the midsagittal plane. Twelve angle values and 8 length values were measured on both LCR and CBCT and compared. Results:Repeated measures analysis of the variance revealed statistically significant differences in 7 angular and 5 linear measurements among LCR and 3 types of CBCT (p < 0.05). Of these 12 measurements, multiple comparisons showed that 6 measurements (ANB, AB to FH, IMPA, FMA, Co-Gn, Go-Me) were not significantly different in pairwise comparisons.

The CBCT method was similar for all measurements, except for 1 linear measurement, i.e., S-N. However, the disparity between the mean values for all parameters was within the range of clinical measurement error. Conclusions:3D-CBCT analysis, using midsagittal projection, is a useful method in which the 2D-LCR normative values can be used.

Torque control during lingual anterior retraction without posterior appliances.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23502971/,"Objective:To evaluate the factors that affect torque control during anterior retraction when utilizing the C-retractor with a palatal miniplate as an exclusive source of anchorage without posterior appliances. Methods:The C-retractor was modeled using a 3-dimensional beam element (0.9-mm-diameter stainless-steel wire) attached to mesh bonding pads. Various vertical heights and 2 attachment positions for the lingual anterior retraction hooks (LARHs) were evaluated. A force of 200 g was applied from each side hook of the miniplate to the splinted segment of 6 or 8 anterior teeth. Results:During anterior retraction, an increase in the LARH vertical height increased the amount of lingual root torque and intrusion of the incisors. In particular, with increasing vertical height, the tooth displacement pattern changed from controlled tipping to bodily displacement and then to lingual root displacement. The effects were enhanced when the LARH was located between the central and lateral incisors, as compared to when the LARH was located between the lateral incisors and canines. Conclusions:Three-dimensional lingual anterior retraction of the 6 or 8 anterior teeth can be accomplished using the palatal miniplate as the only anchorage source. Using LARHs at different heights or positions affects the quality of torque and intrusion.","Sung-Seo Mo,Seong-Hun Kim,Sang-Jin Sung,Kyu-Rhim Chung,Yun-Sic Chun,Yoon-Ah Kook,Gerald Nelson","Anchorage,C-retractor,Lingual,Miniplate."
Active-treatment effects of the Forsus fatigue resistant device during comprehensive Class II correction in growing patients.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24892027/,"Objective:To evaluate the active-treatment effects of the Forsus fatigue resistant device (Forsus) during comprehensive correction of Class II malocclusion in growing patients. Methods:Fifty-four patients (mean age, 12.5 ± 1.2 years) with Class II division 1 malocclusion were consecutively treated with fixed app-liances in combination with Forsus. Lateral cephalograms were analyzed at the beginning of the fixed treatment (T1), Forsus insertion (T2), its removal (T3), and end of the comprehensive therapy (T4). Statistical comparisons were carried out by repeated-measures ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc test (p < 0.05). Results:The overall therapeutic effects were mainly dentoalveolar and occurred mostly during the active treatment with Forsus (T2-T3, mean duration = 0.5 ± 0.1 years). The overjet and overbite decreased significantly (-3.5 and -1.5 mm, respectively) and the molar relationship improved by 4.3 mm. These changes were associated with significant retroclination of the maxillary incisors (-3.1°), proclination and intrusion of the mandibular incisors (+5.0° and -1.5 mm, respectively), and mesialization of the mandibular molars (+2.0 mm). Conclusions:Forsus had mainly dentoalveolar effects and contributed largely to the overall therapeutic outcome.","Giorgio Cacciatore,Lisa Alvetro,Efisio Defraia,Luis Tomas Huanc Ghislanzoni,Lorenzo Franchi","Cephalometrics,Class II malocclusion,Fixed functional appliance."
Three-dimensional assessment of upper lip positional changes according to simulated maxillary anterior tooth movements by white light scanning.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25473644/,"Objective:Esthetic improvements during orthodontic treatment are achieved by changes in positions of the lips and surrounding soft tissues. Facial soft-tissue movement has already been two-dimensionally evaluated by cephalometry. In this study, we aimed to three-dimensionally assess positional changes of the adult upper lip according to simulated maxillary anterior tooth movements by white light scanning. Methods:We measured changes in three-dimensional coordinates of labial landmarks in relation to maxillary incisor movements of normal adults simulated with films of varying thickness by using a white light scanner. Results:With increasing protraction, the upper lip moved forward and significantly upward. Labial movement was limited by the surrounding soft tissues. The extent of movement above the vermilion border was slightly less than half that of the teeth, showing strong correlation. Most changes were concentrated in the depression above the upper vermilion border. Labial movement toward the nose was reduced significantly. Conclusions:After adequately controlling several variables and using white light scanning with high reproducibility and accuracy, the coefficient of determination showed moderate values (0.40-0.77) and significant changes could be determined. This method would be useful to predict soft-tissue positional changes according to tooth movements.","Hwee-Ho Kim,Jin-Woo Lee,Kyung-Suk Cha,Dong-Hwa Chung,Sang-Min Lee","Esthetics,Lip changing,Soft tissue,Three-dimensional scanner."
"Enhanced compatibility and initial stability of Ti6Al4V alloy orthodontic miniscrews subjected to anodization, cyclic precalcification, and heat treatment.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25309864/,"Objective:To evaluate the bioactivity, and the biomechanical and bone-regenerative properties of Ti6Al4V miniscrews subjected to anodization, cyclic precalcification, and heat treatment (APH treatment) and their potential clinical use. Methods:The surfaces of Ti6Al4V alloys were modified by APH treatment. Bioactivity was assessed after immersion in simulated body fluid for 3 days. The hydrophilicity and the roughness of APH-treated surfaces were compared with those of untreated (UT) and anodized and heat-treated (AH) samples. For in vivo tests, 32 miniscrews (16 UT and 16 APH) were inserted into 16 Wistar rats, one UT and one APH-treated miniscrew in either tibia. The miniscrews were extracted after 3 and 6 weeks and their osseointegration (n = 8 for each time point and group) was investigated by surface and histological analyses and removal torque measurements. Results:APH treatment formed a dense surface array of nanotubular TiO2 layer covered with a compact apatite-like film. APH-treated samples showed better bioactivity and biocompatibility compared with UT and AH samples. In vivo, APH-treated miniscrews showed higher removal torque and bone-to-implant contact than did UT miniscrews, after both 3 and 6 weeks (p < 0.05). Also, early deposition of densely mineralized bone around APH-treated miniscrews was observed, implying good bonding to the treated surface. Conclusions:APH treatment enhanced the bioactivity, and the biomechanical and bone regenerative properties of the Ti6Al4V alloy miniscrews. The enhanced initial stability afforded should be valuable in orthodontic applications.","Eun-Ju Oh,Thuy-Duong T Nguyen,Seung-Youp Lee,Young-Mi Jeon,Tae-Sung Bae,Jong-Gee Kim","Biocompatibility,Orthodontic mini-implant,Stability,Surface treatment."

Effects of silanation time on shear bond strength between a gold alloy surface and metal bracket.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814707/,"Objective:We aimed to investigate the effects of silanation time on the shear bond strength (SBS) of metal brackets on gold alloy in a silicoating procedure and compare the SBS of metal brackets on gold alloy and enamel. Methods:Type III gold alloy plates were sandblasted with 30-µm silicon dioxide. Excess particles were removed with gentle air after silica coating, and silane was applied. Maxillary central-incisor metal brackets were bonded to each conditioned alloy surface with a light curing resin adhesive for 1 s, 30 s, 60 s, or 120 s after applying silane. The brackets were also bonded to 36 upper central incisors with the same adhesive. All samples were cured for 40 s with a light emitting diode curing light. The SBS was tested after 1 h and after 24 h. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) of the samples was also compared. Results:The 60-s and 120-s silanation time groups showed a higher SBS than the other groups (p < 0.05). Samples tested after 24 h showed a significantly higher SBS than did the samples tested after 1 h (p < 0.05). The 1-s group showed higher ARI scores. The one-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls test showed that the SBS values of the 60-s and 120-s silanation time groups were not significantly different from the SBS values of enamel.

Computed tomography (CT) of the maxillary anterior region was performed to investigate the nature of the outgrowths. In 8 of the 16 patients, hemispheric or disc-shaped osseous outgrowths were observed on the sites where piezosurgery was performed during retraction. CT images revealed that these outgrowths were alveolar bone. This case series presents a previously unreported osseous response to piezosurgery-assisted tooth movement during orthodontic treatment.

Changes in buccal facial depth of female patients after extraction and nonextraction orthodontic treatments: A preliminary study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29732303/,"Objective:This study was performed to investigate buccal facial depth (BFD) changes after extraction and nonextraction orthodontic treatments in post-adolescent and adult female patients, and to explore possible influencing factors. Methods:Twelve and nine female patients were enrolled in the extraction and nonextraction groups, respectively. Changes in BFD in the defined buccal region and six transverse and two coronal measuring planes were measured after registering pretreatment and posttreatment three-dimensional facial scans. Changes in posterior dentoalveolar arch widths were also measured. Treatment duration, changes in body mass index (BMI), and cephalometric variables were compared between the groups. Results:BFD in the buccal region decreased by approximately 1.45 mm in the extraction group, but no significant change was observed in the nonextraction group. In the extraction group, the decrease in BFD was identical between the two coronal measuring planes, whereas this differed among the six transverse measuring planes. Posterior dentoalveolar arch widths decreased in the extraction group, whereas these increased at the second premolar level in the nonextraction group. The treatment duration of the extraction group was twice that of the nonextraction group. No differences were found in BMI and Frankfort horizontal-mandibular plane angle changes between the groups. BFD changes in the buccal region moderately correlated with treatment duration and dental arch width change. Conclusions:BFD decreased in adult female patients undergoing extraction, and this may be influenced by the long treatment duration and constriction of dentoalveolar arch width. However, nonextraction treatment did not significantly alter BFD.","Fanfan Dai,Jie Yu,Gui Chen,Tianmin Xu,Ruoping Jiang","Adult treatment,Extraction vs. nonextraction,Soft tissue,Three-dimensional scanner."

Methods:Thirty-one adult female patients with skeletal Class I or II dentoalveolar protrusion, mild-to-moderate anterior crowding (3.0-6.0 mm), and stable Class I posterior occlusion were divided into conventional (n = 15) and preformed (n = 16) C-wire groups. All subjects underwent first premolar extractions and en-masse retraction with pre-adjusted edgewise anterior brackets, the assigned C-wire, and maxillary C-tubes or C-implants; bonded mesh-tube appliances were used in the mandibular dentition. Differences in pretreatment and post-retraction measurements of skeletal, dental, and soft-tissue cephalometric variables were statistically analyzed. Results:Both groups showed full retraction of the maxillary anterior teeth by controlled tipping and space closure without altered posterior occlusion. However, the preformed C-wire group had a shorter retraction period (by 3.2 months). Furthermore, the maxillary molars in this group showed no significant mesialization, mesial tipping, or extrusion; some mesialization and mesial tipping occurred in the conventional C-wire group. Conclusions:Preformed C-wires combined with maxillary TSADs enable simultaneous leveling and space closure from the beginning of the treatment without maxillary posterior bonding.

Methods:PDL stem cells were isolated from 7 extracted human premolar teeth. Human PDL cells were expanded in culture, stained using anti-CD29, -CD34, -CD44, and -STRO-1 antibodies, and sorted by fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS). Gingival fibroblasts (GFs) served as a positive control. PDL stem cells and GFs were cultured using standard conditions conducive for osteogenic, chondrogenic, or adipogenic differentiation. Results:An average of 152.8 ± 27.6 colony-forming units was present at day 7 in cultures of PDL stem cells. At day 4, PDL stem cells exhibited a significant increase in proliferation (p < 0.05), reaching nearly double the proliferation rate of GFs. About 5.6 ± 4.5% of cells in human PDL tissues were strongly STRO-1-positive. In osteogenic cultures, calcium nodules were observed by day 21 in PDL stem cells, which showed more intense calcium staining than GF cultures. In adipogenic cultures, both cell populations showed positive Oil Red O staining by day 21. Additionally, in chondrogenic cultures, PDL stem cells expressed collagen type II by day 21. Conclusions:The PDL contains multipotent stem cells that have the potential to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes.

Methods:Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of 28 adults with UCLP were analyzed in this study. Segmented three-dimensional temporomandibular fossa and mandible images were reconstructed, and angular, linear, and volumetric parameters were measured. Results:For all 28 individuals, the chin was found to deviate to the cleft side by 1.59 mm. Moreover, among these 28 individuals, only 7 showed distinct (more than 4 mm) chin deviation, which was toward the cleft side. Compared to the non-cleft side, the mandibular body length, frontal ramal inclination, and vertical position of the condyle were lower and inclination of the temporomandibular fossa was steeper on the cleft side. Furthermore, the differences in inclination of the temporomandibular fossa, mandibular body length, ramus length, and condylar volume ratio (non-deviated/deviated) were positively correlated with chin deviation. Conclusions:UCLP individuals show mild chin deviation to the cleft side. Statistical differences were noted in the parameters that represented positional and morphological asymmetries of the mandible and temporomandibular fossa; however, these differences were too small to indicate clinical significance.","Kyung-Seon Kim,Woo-Sung Son,Soo-Byung Park,Seong-Sik Kim,Yong-Il Kim","Asymmetry,Cleft lip and palate,Computed tomography."

Combined treatment with headgear and the Frog appliance for maxillary molar distalization: a randomized controlled trial.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23671835/,"Objective:To evaluate the efficiency of the Frog appliance (FA) alone or in combination with headgear for distalizing the maxillary molars. Methods:Fifty patients (25 males and 25 females) aged 12.6 - 16.7 years who received treatment for Class II malocclusion at the Orthodontic Clinic of Al-Baath University were selected for this study and randomly divided into 2 equal groups. Maxillary molar distalization was achieved using the FA alone (group 1) or a combination of the FA with high-pull headgear worn at night (group 2). Lateral cephalograms were obtained before and after treatment. Results:The maxillary molars moved distally by 5.51 and 5.93 mm in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Distal movements were associated with axial tipping by 4.96° and 1.25°, and with loss of anchorage by mesial movement of the second maxillary premolars by 2.70 and 0.90 mm in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The combined use of the FA and nighttime high-pull headgear decreased the distalization time and improved the ratio of maxillary molar distalization movement relative to the overall opening space between the first maxillary molars and second premolars. Conclusions:The FA can effectively distalize the maxillary molars, this distalization associates with some unfavorable changes. Nighttime use of high-pull headgear combined with the FA can reduce these unfavorable changes and improve treatment outcomes.",Ahmad Sharafeddin Burhan,"Headgear,Malocclusion,Molar distalization,Orthodontic appliances."
New approach of maxillary protraction using modified C-palatal plates in Class III patients.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26258067/,"Maxillary protraction is the conventional treatment for growing Class III patients with maxillary deficiency, but it has undesirable dental effects.

Facial profile parameters and their relative influence on bilabial prominence and the perceptions of facial profile attractiveness: A novel approach.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25133133/,"Objective:To evaluate the relative importance of bilabial prominence in relation to other facial profile parameters in a normal population. Methods:Profile stimulus images of 38 individuals (28 female and 10 male; ages 19-25 years) were shown to an unrelated group of first-year students (n = 42; ages 18-24 years). The images were individually viewed on a 17-inch monitor. The observers received standardized instructions before viewing. A six-question questionnaire was completed using a Likert-type scale. The responses were analyzed by ordered logistic regression to identify associations between profile characteristics and observer preferences. The Bayesian Information Criterion was used to select variables that explained observer preferences most accurately. Results:Nasal, bilabial, and chin prominences; the nasofrontal angle; and lip curls had the greatest effect on overall profile attractiveness perceptions. The lip-chin-throat angle and upper lip curl had the greatest effect on forehead prominence perceptions. The bilabial prominence, nasolabial angle (particularly the lower component), and mentolabial angle had the greatest effect on nasal prominence perceptions. The bilabial prominence, nasolabial angle, chin prominence, and submental length had the greatest effect on lip prominence perceptions. The bilabial prominence, nasolabial angle, mentolabial angle, and submental length had the greatest effect on chin prominence perceptions. Conclusions:More prominent lips, within normal limits, may be considered more attractive in the profile view. Profile parameters have a greater influence on their neighboring aesthetic units but indirectly influence related profile parameters, endorsing the importance of achieving an aesthetic balance between relative prominences of all aesthetic units of the facial profile.","Erin Stewart Denize,Fraser McDonald,Martyn Sherriff,Farhad B Naini","Attractiveness,Facial profile,Lip prominence,Perception."
Miniscrews versus surgical archwires for intermaxillary fixation in adults after orthognathic surgery.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25667912/,"Objective:We compared the skeletal and dental changes that resulted from the use of two methods of intermaxillary fixation (IMF)-miniscrews and surgical archwire-in 74 adult patients who had Class III malocclusion and were treated with the same orthognathic surgical procedure at a hospital in Korea. Methods:All the patients underwent Le Fort I osteotomy and bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy with rigid fixation. They were divided into two groups according to the type of IMF used-group 1 underwent surgical archwire fixation and group 2 underwent orthodontic miniscrew fixation. In a series of cephalograms for each patient, we compared vertical and horizontal tooth-position measurements: (a) immediately after surgery (T0), (b) 3 months after surgery (T1), and (c) 6 months after surgery (T2). Cephalometric changes within each group were examined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) while the independent samples t-test procedure was used to compare the two groups. Results:After surgery, the maxillary incisors tended to be proclined in both groups although there were no significant differences. Incisor overbite increased significantly in both groups from T0 to T1, and the miniscrew group (group 2) showed slightly greater overbite than the archwire group (group 1). Conclusions:This study suggest that the use of orthodontic miniscrews and orthodontic surgical archwire for IMF in adult patients results in similar skeletal and dental changes.","Sieun Son,Seong Sik Kim,Woo-Sung Son,Yong-Il Kim,Yong-Deok Kim,Sang-Hun Shin","Cephalometrics,Microimplant,Surgery."

Maxillomandibular arch width differences at estimated centers of resistance: Comparison between normal occlusion and skeletal Class III malocclusion.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28523243/,"Objective:To evaluate the differences in maxillomandibular transverse measurements at either the crown or the estimated center of resistance (CR), and to compare values between normal occlusion and Class III malocclusion groups. Methods:Dental casts and computed tomography (CT) data from 30 individuals with normal occlusion and 30 with skeletal Class III malocclusions were evaluated. Using the casts, dental arch widths (DAWs) were measured from the cusp tips, and basal arch widths (BAWs-cast) were measured as the distance between the points at the mucogingival junction adjacent to the respective cusp tips. The BAWs determined from CT (BAWs-CT) images were measured from the estimated CRs of the teeth. Results:None of the DAW measurements or maxillomandibular DAW differences showed statistically significant intergroup differences. In contrast, the maxillary BAWs-CT and BAWs-cast were lesser in the Class III malocclusion group than in the normal occlusion group. The mandibular BAWs-CT were significantly greater in the Class III malocclusion group than in the normal occlusion group. Moreover, the maxillomandibular BAW differences on both CT and cast showed significant intergroup differences in all transverse measurements. Conclusions:The maxillomandibular DAW differences showed no significant intergroup differences. In contrast, the maxillomandibular BAW differences on both CT and cast showed significant intergroup differences in all transverse measurements. The maxillomandibular BAW differences at the estimated CRs, measured using CT or casts, can reveal underlying transverse maxillary basal arch deficiencies in patients with skeletal Class III malocclusions.","Yun-Jin Koo,Sung-Hwan Choi,Byeong-Tak Keum,Hyung-Seog Yu,Chung-Ju Hwang,Birte Melsen,Kee-Joon Lee","Centers of resistance,Class III malocclusion,Computed tomography,Maxillomandibular basal arch width differences."

Methods:We created a three-dimensional (3D) maxilla model of a dentition with extracted first premolars and used 2 types of miniscrews (tapered and cylindrical) with 1.45-mm diameters and 8-mm lengths. The miniscrews were inserted at 30°, 60°, and 90° angles with respect to the bone surface. A simulated horizontal orthodontic force of 2 N was applied to the miniscrew heads. Then, the stress distributions, magnitudes during miniscrew placement, and force applications were analyzed with a 3D finite element analysis. Results:Stresses were primarily absorbed by cortical bone. Moreover, very little stress was transmitted to the roots, PDLs, and cancellous bone. During cylindrical miniscrew insertion, the maximum von Mises stress increased as insertion angle decreased. Tapered miniscrews exhibited greater maximum von Mises stress than cylindrical miniscrews. During force application, maximum von Mises stresses increased in both groups as insertion angles decreased. Conclusions:For both cylindrical and tapered miniscrew designs, placement as perpendicular to the bone surface as possible is recommended to reduce stress in the surrounding bone.","Sung-Hwan Choi,Seong-Jin Kim,Kee-Joon Lee,Sang-Jin Sung,Youn-Sic Chun,Chung-Ju Hwang","Finite element analysis,Miniscrew design,Orthodontic miniscrews,Stress."

Surface superimposition was based on the basal bone structure of the mandible by surface-to-surface matching (best-fit method). Plane superimposition was based on anatomical structures (mental and lingual foramen). For the evaluation, 10 landmarks including teeth and anatomic structures were assigned, and 30 times of superimpositions and measurements were performed to determine the more reproducible and reliable method. Results:All landmarks demonstrated that the surface superimposition method produced relatively more consistent coordinate values. The mean distances of measured landmarks values from the means were statistically significantly lower with the surface superimpositions method.

Treatment and retention of relapsed anterior open-bite with low tongue posture and tongue-tie: A 10-year follow-up.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25133135/,"The purpose of the current report is to present 6-year long-term stability and 10-year follow-up data for an adult patient who was treated with a tongue elevator for relapsed anterior open-bite. The 19-year-old male patient presented with the chief complaint of difficulty in chewing his food. Collectively, clinical and radiographic examinations revealed an anterior open-bite, low tongue posture, and tongue-tie. The patient opted for orthodontic treatment alone, without any surgical procedure. A lingual frenectomy was recommended to avoid the risk of relapse, but the patient declined because he was not experiencing tongue discomfort. Initial treatment of the anterior open-bite with molar intrusion and tongue exercises was successful, but relapse occurred during the retention period. A tongue elevator was used for retreatment, because the approach was minimally invasive and suited the patient's requirements regarding discomfort, cost, and time. The appliance changed the tongue posture and generated an altered tongue force, which ultimately resulted in intrusive dentoalveolar effects, and a subsequent counterclockwise rotation of the mandible. The results showed long-term stability and were maintained for six years through continual use of the tongue elevator. The results of this case indicated that a tongue elevator could be used not only as an alternative treatment for open-bite, but also as an active retainer.","Yu-Jin Seo,Su-Jung Kim,Janchivdorj Munkhshur,Kyu-Rhim Chung,Peter Ngan,Seong-Hun Kim","Open-bite,Relapse,Retention,Tongue elevator."
Effectiveness of en-masse retraction using midpalatal miniscrews and a modified transpalatal arch: Treatment duration and dentoskeletal changes.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24696825/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to compare the treatment duration and dentoskeletal changes between two different anchorage systems used to treat maxillary dentoalveolar protrusion and to examine the effectiveness of en-masse retraction using two miniscrews placed in the midpalatal suture. Methods:Fifty-seven patients (9 men, 48 women), who had undergone level anchorage system treatment at Aichi-Gakuin University Dental Hospital (Nagoya, Japan) were divided into two groups according to the method of maxillary posterior anchorage reinforcement: midpalatal miniscrews (25 patients, mean age 22 years) and conventional anchorage (32 patients, mean age 19 years). The en-masse retraction period, overall treatment duration, pre-treatment effective ANB angle, and change in the effective ANB angle were compared with an independent-samples t-test. Results:Compared to the headgear group, the duration of en-masse retraction was longer by approximately 4 months in the miniscrew group (p < 0.001). However, we found no significant difference in the total treatment duration between the groups. Moreover, a greater change in the effective ANB angle was observed in patients treated with miniscrews than in those treated with the conventional method (p < 0.05). Conclusions:The level anchorage system treatment using miniscrews placed in the midpalatal area will allow orthodontists more time to control the anterior teeth during en-masse retraction, without increasing the total treatment duration. Furthermore, it achieves better dentoskeletal control than does the conventional anchorage method, thereby improving the quality of the treatment results.","Jungkil Lee,Ken Miyazawa,Masako Tabuchi,Takuma Sato,Misuzu Kawaguchi,Shigemi Goto","Appliances,Diagnosis and treatment planning,Orthodontic mini-implant,Orthodontic treatment."

This study aimed to help select ideal biomechanics during maxillary incisor retraction by varying the length in the anterior retraction hook (ARH) and OMI position. Methods:Two extraction models were constructed to analyze the three-dimentional finite element: a first premolar extraction model (Model 1, M1) and a residual 1-mm space post-extraction model (Model 2, M2). The OMI position was set at a height of 8 mm from the arch wire between the second maxillary premolar and the first molar (low OMI traction) or at a 12-mm height in the mesial second maxillary premolar (high OMI traction). Retraction force vectors of 200 g from the ARH (-1, +1, +3, and +6 mm) at low or high OMI traction were resolved into X-, Y-, and Z-axis components. Results:In M1 (low and high OMI traction) and M2 (low OMI traction), the maxillary incisor tip was extruded, but the apex was intruded, and the occlusal plane was rotated clockwise. Significant intrusion and counter-clockwise rotation in the occlusal plane were observed under high OMI traction and -1 mm ARH in M2. Conclusions:This study observed orthodontic tooth movement according to the OMI position and ARH height, and M2 under high OMI traction with short ARH showed retraction with maxillary incisor intrusion.","Jae-Won Song,Joong-Ki Lim,Kee-Joon Lee,Sang-Jin Sung,Youn-Sic Chun,Sung-Seo Mo","Finite element model,Mini-implant,Tooth movement."

Methods:Forty-three patients (19 men, 24 women) with Class II malocclusion were retrospectively selected for the study. Twenty-four patients (mean age, 12.2 ± 1.5 years) were treated with the PA, and 19 patients (mean age, 11.3 ± 1.9 years) were treated with the DS. The mean distalization time was 7 months for the PA group and 9 months for the DS group. Lateral cephalograms were obtained at T1, before treatment, and at T2, the end of distalization. A Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical comparisons of the two groups between T1 and T2. Results:PA and DS were equally effective in distalizing maxillary molars (4.7 mm and 4.2 mm, respectively) between T1 and T2; however, the maxillary first molars showed less distal tipping in the DS group than in the PA group (3.2° vs. 9.0°, respectively). Moreover, significant premolar anchorage loss (2.7 mm) and incisor proclination (5.0°) were noted in the PA group, whereas premolar distal movement (1.9 mm) and no significant changes at the incisor (0.1°) were observed in the DS group. No significant sagittal or vertical skeletal changes were detected between the two groups during the distalization phase.

Methods:A retrospective study of 34 patients (23 men, 11 women; mean age, 26.2 ± 6.6 years) with skeletal Class III deformities, who underwent surgery-first orthodontic treatment, was conducted. Skeletal landmarks in the maxilla and mandible at three time points, pre-treatment (T0), immediate-postoperative (T1), and post-treatment (T2), were analyzed using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-generated half-cephalograms. Results:The significant T0 to T1 mandibular changes occurred -9.24 ± 3.97 mm horizontally. From T1 to T2, the mandible tended to move forward 1.22 ± 2.02 mm, while the condylar position (Cd to Po-perpendicular plane) shifted backward, and the coronoid process (Cp to FH plane) moved vertically. Between T1 and T2, the vertical dimension changed significantly (p < 0.05). Changes in the vertical dimension were significantly correlated to T1 to T2 changes in the Cd to Po-perpendicular plane (r = -0.671, p = 0.034), and in the Cp to FH plane (r = 0.733, p = 0.016), as well as to T0 to T1 changes in the Cp to Po-perpendicular plane (r = 0.758, p = 0.011).

After 25 months of active orthodontic treatment, the patient had a Class I molar and canine relationship on both sides, with ideal overbite and overjet values. Her profile was improved, her lips were competent, and cephalometric evaluation showed acceptable maxillary and mandibular incisor inclinations. The final panoramic radiograph showed that good root parallelism was achieved. Two-year follow-up intraoral photography showed stable results.","Antonio Gracco,Laura Siviero,Alessandro Perri,Lorenzo Favero,Edoardo Stellini","Class III malocclusion,Dental transposition,Three-dimensional diagnosis,Young patient."
Differences in the mandibular premolar positions in Angle Class I subjects with different vertical facial types: A cone-beam computed tomography study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26258064/,"Objective:To compare the positions of the mandibular premolars in Angle Class I subjects according to vertical facial type. The results will provide a theoretical basis for predicting effective tooth movement in orthodontic treatment. Methods:Cephalometric parameters were determined using cone-beam computed tomography in 120 Angle Class I subjects. Subjects were categorized as short, normal, and long face types according to the Frankfort mandibular angle. Parameters indicating the position of the mandibular right premolars and the mandible were also measured. Results:The angle between the mandibular first premolar axis and buccal cortex, the distance between the root apex and buccal cortex, angle of vestibularization, arc of vestibularization, and root apex maximum movable distance were significantly greater in the short face type than in the long and norm face types. The angle between the mandibular second premolar axis and buccal cortex, the distance from root apex to buccal cortex, and the arc of vestibularization were significantly greater in the short face type than in the normal face type.

Comparison of changes in the transverse dental axis between patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry treated by orthognathic surgery with and without presurgical orthodontic treatment.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28670567/,"Objective:To evaluate transverse skeletal and dental changes, including those in the buccolingual dental axis, between patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry after bilateral intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy with and without presurgical orthodontic treatment. Methods:This retrospective study included 29 patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry including menton deviation > 4 mm from the midsagittal plane. To evaluate changes in transverse skeletal and dental variables (i.e., buccolingual inclination of the upper and lower canines and first molars), the data for 16 patients who underwent conventional orthognathic surgery (CS) were compared with those for 13 patients who underwent preorthodontic orthognathic surgery (POGS), using three-dimensional computed tomography at initial examination, 1 month before surgery, and at 7 days and 1 year after surgery. Results:The 1-year postsurgical examination revealed no significant changes in the postoperative transverse dental axis in the CS group. In the POGS group, the upper first molar inclined lingually on both sides (deviated side, -1.8° ± 2.8°,p= 0.044; nondeviated side, -3.7° ± 3.3°,p= 0.001) and the lower canine inclined lingually on the nondeviated side (4.0° ± 5.4°,p= 0.022) during postsurgical orthodontic treatment. There were no significant differences in the skeletal and dental variables between the two groups at 1 year after surgery. Conclusions:POGS may be a clinically acceptable alternative to CS as a treatment to achieve stable transverse axes of the dentition in both arches in patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry.","Han-Sol Song,Sung-Hwan Choi,Jung-Yul Cha,Kee-Joon Lee,Hyung-Seog Yu","Facial asymmetry,Preorthodontic orthognathic surgery,Three-dimensional computed tomography,Transverse dental axis."
Comparison of three different orthodontic wires for bonded lingual retainer fabrication.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112930/,"Objective:We evaluated the detachment force, amount of deformation, fracture mode, and pull-out force of 3 different wires used for bonded lingual retainer fabrication. Methods:We tested 0.0215-inch five-stranded wire (PentaOne, Masel; group I), 0.016 × 0.022-inch dead-soft eight-braided wire (Bond-A-Braid, Reliance; group II), and 0.0195-inch dead-soft coaxial wire (Respond, Ormco; group III). To test detachment force, deformation, and fracture mode, we embedded 94 lower incisor teeth in acrylic blocks in pairs. Retainer wires were bonded to the teeth and vertically directed force was applied to the wire. To test pull-out force, wires were embedded in composite that was placed in a hole at the center of an acrylic block. Tensile force was applied along the long axis of the wire. Results:Detachment force and mode of fracture were not different between groups. Deformation was significantly higher in groups II and III than in group I (p < 0.001). Mean pull-out force was significantly higher for group I compared to groups II and III (p < 0.001). Conclusions:Detachment force and fracture mode were similar for all wires, but greater deformations were seen in dead-soft wires. Wire pull-out force was significantly higher for five-stranded coaxial wire than for the other wires tested. Five-stranded coaxial wires are suggested for use in bonded lingual retainers.","Asli Baysal,Tancan Uysal,Nisa Gul,Melike Busra Alan,Sabri Ilhan Ramoglu","Bonding and aligner,Wire."
"Long-term stability after multidisciplinary treatment involving maxillary distraction osteogenesis, and sagittal split ramus osteotomy for unilateral cleft lip and palate with severe occlusal collapse and gingival recession: A case report.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30603626/,"In this report, we describe a case involving a 34-year-old woman who showed good treatment outcomes with long-term stability after multidisciplinary treatment for unilateral cleft lip and palate (CLP), maxillary hypoplasia, severe maxillary arch constriction, severe occlusal collapse, and gingival recession. A comprehensive treatment approach was developed with maximum consideration of strong scar constriction and gingival recession; it included minimum maxillary arch expansion, maxillary advancement by distraction osteogenesis using an internal distraction device, and mandibular setback using sagittal split ramus osteotomy. Her post-treatment records demonstrated a balanced facial profile and occlusion with improved facial symmetry. The patient's profile was dramatically improved, with reduced upper lip retrusion and lower lip protrusion as a result of the maxillary advancement and mandibular setback, respectively. Although gingival recession showed a slight increase, tooth mobility was within the normal physiological range. No tooth hyperesthesia was observed after treatment. There was negligible osseous relapse, and the occlusion remained stable after 5 years of post-treatment retention. Our findings suggest that such multidisciplinary approaches for the treatment of CLP with gingival recession and occlusal collapse help in improving occlusion and facial esthetics without the need for prostheses such as dental implants or bridges; in addition, the results show long-term post-treatment stability.","Satoshi Kokai,Eiji Fukuyama,Susumu Omura,Sachiko Kimizuka,Ikuo Yonemitsu,Koichi Fujita,Takashi Ono","Cleft lip and palate,Distraction osteogenesis,Gingival recession,Orthodontic treatment planning."

Evaluation of different enamel conditioning techniques for orthodontic bonding.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112929/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to compare the effects of different enamel conditioning techniques for bracket bonding. Methods:Ninety-one human premolars were randomly divided in six groups of 15 specimens each. The enamel surfaces of the teeth were etched with 35% orthophosphoric acid in Group 1, with a self-etching primer in Group 2, sandblasted in Group 3, sandblasted and etched with 35% orthophosphoric acid in Group 4, conditioned by Er:YAG laser in Group 5 and conditioned by Er:YAG laser and etched with 35% phosphoric acid gel respectively in Group 6. After enamel conditioning procedures, brackets were bonded and shear bonding test was performed. After debonding, adhesive remnant index scores were calculated for all groups. One tooth from each group were inspected by scanning electron microscope for evaluating the enamel surface characteristics. Results:The laser and acid etched group showed the highest mean shear bond strength (SBS) value (13.61 ± 1.14 MPa) while sandblasted group yielded the lowest value (3.12 ± 0.61 MPa). Conclusions:Although the SBS values were higher, the teeth in laser conditioned groups were highly damaged. Therefore, acid etching and self-etching techniques were found to be safer for orthodontic bracket bonding. Sandblasting method was found to generate inadequate bonding strength.","Cagrı Türköz,Cagrı Ulusoy","Adhesive,Bonding,Resin."

Evaluation of mandibular cortical bone thickness for placement of temporary anchorage devices (TADs).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112941/,"Objective:In this study, we measured the cortical bone thickness in the mandibular buccal and lingual areas using computed tomography in order to evaluate the suitability of these areas for application of temporary anchorage devices (TADs) and to suggest a clinical guide for TADs. Methods:The buccal and lingual cortical bone thickness was measured in 15 men and 15 women. Bone thickness was measured 4 mm apical to the interdental cementoenamel junction between the mandibular canine and the 2nd molar using the transaxial slices in computed tomography images. Results:The cortical bone in the mandibular buccal and lingual areas was thicker in men than in women. In men, the mandibular lingual cortical bone was thicker than the buccal cortical bone, except between the 1st and 2nd molars on both sides. In women, the mandibular lingual cortical bone was thicker in all regions when compared to the buccal cortical bone. The mandibular buccal cortical bone thickness increased from the canine to the molars. The mandibular lingual cortical bone was thickest between the 1st and 2nd premolars, followed by the areas between the canine and 1st premolar, between the 2nd premolar and 1st molar, and between the 1st molar and 2nd molar. Conclusions:There is sufficient cortical bone for TAD applications in the mandibular buccal and lingual areas.

Management of acquired open bite associated with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis using miniscrew anchorage.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112945/,"This article reports the orthodontic treatment of a patient with skeletal mandibular retrusion and an anterior open bite due to temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA) using miniscrew anchorage. A 46-year-old woman had a Class II malocclusion with a retropositioned mandible. Her overjet and overbite were 7.0 mm and -1.6 mm, respectively. She had limited mouth opening, TMJ sounds, and pain. Condylar resorption was observed in both TMJs. Her TMJ pain was reduced by splint therapy, and then orthodontic treatment was initiated. Titanium miniscrews were placed at the posterior maxilla to intrude the molars. After 2 years and 7 months of orthodontic treatment, an acceptable occlusion was achieved without any recurrence of TMJ symptoms. The retropositioned mandible was considerably improved, and the lips showed less tension upon lip closure. The maxillary molars were intruded by 1.5 mm, and the mandible was subsequently rotated counterclockwise. Magnetic resonance imaging of both condyles after treatment showed avascular necrosis-like structures. During a 2-year retention period, an acceptable occlusion was maintained without recurrence of the open bite. In conclusion, correction of open bite and clockwise-rotated mandible through molar intrusion using titanium miniscrews is effective for the management of TMJ-OA with jaw deformity.","Eiji Tanaka,Eizo Yamano,Toshihiro Inubushi,Shingo Kuroda","Orthodontic mini-implant,Orthodontic treatment,TMJ."

Effect of surface anodization on stability of orthodontic microimplant.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112925/,"Objective:To determine the effect of surface anodization on the interfacial strength between an orthodontic microimplant (MI) and the rabbit tibial bone, particularly in the initial phase after placement. Methods:A total of 36 MIs were driven into the tibias of 3 mature rabbits by using the self-drilling method and then removed after 6 weeks. Half the MIs were as-machined (n = 18; machined group), while the remaining had anodized surfaces (n = 18; anodized group). The peak insertion torque (PIT) and the peak removal torque (PRT) values were measured for the 2 groups of MIs. These values were then used to calculate the interfacial shear strength between the MI and cortical bone. Results:There were no statistical differences in terms of PIT between the 2 groups. However, mean PRT was significantly greater for the anodized implants (3.79 ± 1.39 Ncm) than for the machined ones (2.05 ± 1.07 Ncm) (p < 0.01). The interfacial strengths, converted from PRT, were calculated at 10.6 MPa and 5.74 MPa for the anodized and machined group implants, respectively. Conclusions:Anodization of orthodontic MIs may enhance their early-phase retention capability, thereby ensuring a more reliable source of absolute anchorage.","Sanket Karmarker,Wonjae Yu,Hee-Moon Kyung","Anodization,Interfacial shear strength,Orthodontic microimplant,Self drilling."

Interdisciplinary rehabilitation of a root-fractured maxillary central incisor: A 12-year follow-up case report.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25133136/,"Single-tooth implantation has become a common treatment solution for replacement of a root-fractured maxillary incisor in adults, but the long-term esthetic results can be unfavorable due to progressive marginal bone loss, resulting in gingival recession. In this case report, a maxillary central incisor with a root fracture in its apical one-third was orthodontically extruded and extracted in a 21-year-old female. Implant surgery was performed after a 3-month healing period, and the final crown was placed about 12 months after extraction. After 12 years, favorable osseous and gingival architectures were visible with adequate bone height and thickness at the buccal cortical plate, and no gingival recession was seen around the implant-supported crown. Although modern dentistry has been shifting toward simplified, clinical procedures and shorter treatment times, both general dentists and orthodontists should be aware of the possible long-term esthetic advantages of orthodontic extrusion of hopelessly fractured teeth for highly esthetically demanding areas and should educate and motivate patients regarding the choice of this treatment solution, if necessary.","Giulio Alessandri Bonetti,Serena Incerti Parenti,Maurizio Ciocci,Luigi Checchi","Interdisciplinary treatment,Orthodontic extrusion,Root fracture,Single-tooth implants."

Methods:Study casts (232 pairs from 232 subjects, yielding a total of 380 sides) were evaluated from both the buccal and lingual aspects, so that molar relationships could be classified according to the scheme devised by Liu and Melsen. Occlusal contact areas were quantified using 3D digital models, which were generated through surface scanning of the study casts. Results:A cusp-to-central fossa relationship was observed from the lingual aspect in the majority of cases classified from the buccal aspect as Class I (89.6%) or mild Class II (86.7%). However, severe Class II cases had lingual cusp-to-mesial triangular fossa or marginal ridge relationships. Mean occlusal contact areas were similar in the Class I and mild Class II groups, while the severe Class II group had significantly lower values than either of the other 2 groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions:Buccal and lingual assessments of molar relationships were not always consistent.

Results:No significant changes were observed in the anterior, superior, or posterior joint space of the TMJ (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant change was observed in TMJ sound (p > 0.05). However, TMJ pain and locking both decreased significantly after surgery (p < 0.05). Conclusions:Due to its simplicity, this method may be feasible and useful for repositioning condyles.","Chang-Youn Lee,Chang-Su Jang,Ju-Won Kim,Jwa-Young Kim,Byoung-Eun Yang","Centric relation,Orthognathic surgery,Temporomandibular joint."

Response of masticatory muscles to passive stretch stimulus - from perspectives of functional appliances.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112934/,"Objective:The aims of this study were to examine whether a passive stretch stimulus by means of a functional appliance induces changes in the fiber composition of masticatory muscles and whether these changes are similar to the changes in stretched limb muscle fibers by using RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical assays. Methods:Five male New Zealand White rabbits were fitted with a prefabricated inclined plane on the maxillary central incisors to force the mandible forward (- 2 mm) and downward (- 4 mm). Further, 1 hind limb was extended and constrained with a cast so that the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was stretched when the animal used the limb. The animals were sacrificed after 1 week and the masseter, lateral pterygoid, and EDL were processed and compared with those from control animals (n = 3). Results:The stretched EDL had a significantly higher percentage of slow fibers, whereas the stretched masticatory muscles did not show changes in the composition of the major contractile proteins after 7 days. Conclusions:The transition of fiber phenotypes in response to a stretch stimulus may take longer in the masticatory muscles than in the limb muscles.",Eung-Kwon Pae,"Extensor digitorum longus,Masticatory muscles,Myosin heavy chains,Stretch."
Comparison between dental and basal arch forms in normal occlusion and Class III malocclusions utilizing cone-beam computed tomography.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23504406/,"Objective:The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the mandibular dental and basal arch forms in subjects with normal occlusion and compare them with those of Class III malocclusion using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods:CBCT images of 32 normal occlusion (19 males, 13 females; 24.3 years) and 33 Class III malocclusion subjects (20 males, 13 females, 22.2 years) were selected. Facial axis and root center points were identified from the left to right mandibular first molars. Distances between the facial axis and root center points for each tooth were calculated, and 4 linear and 2 ratio variables were measured and calculated for each arch form. The variables were compared between groups by independent t-test. Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to assess the relationships between dental and basal variables within each group. Results:The mandibular dental and basal intercanine widths were significantly greater in the Class III group than in normal occlusion subjects (p < 0.05). The dental and basal intercanine widths as well as the dental and basal intermolar widths were strongly correlated in normal occlusion and moderately correlated in Class III malocclusion. Conclusions:The dental arch form demon strated a strong positive correlation with the basal arch form in the normal occlusion group and moderate correlation in the Class III malocclusion group. These results might be helpful for clinicians to have a better understanding of the importance of basal arch form in the alveolar bone.","Kyung Eun Suk,Jae Hyun Park,Mohamed Bayome,Young-Ok Nam,Glenn T Sameshima,Yoon-Ah Kook","Basal arch form,Class III malocclusion,Cone-beam computed tomography,Dental arch form,Normal occlusion."
Assessment of metal artifacts in three-dimensional dental surface models derived by cone-beam computed tomography.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25309862/,"Objective:The aim of this study was to assess artifacts induced by metallic restorations in three-dimensional (3D) dental surface models derived by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods:Fifteen specimens, each with four extracted human premolars and molars embedded in a plaster block, were scanned by CBCT before and after the cavitated second premolars were restored with dental amalgam. Five consecutive surface models of each specimen were created according to increasing restoration size: no restoration (control) and small occlusal, large occlusal, disto-occlusal, and mesio-occluso-distal restorations. After registering each restored model with the control model, maximum linear discrepancy, area, and intensity of the artifacts were measured and compared. Results:Artifacts developed mostly on the buccal and lingual surfaces. They occurred not only on the second premolar but also on the first premolar and first molar. The parametric values increased significantly with increasing restoration size. Conclusions:Metallic restorations induce considerable artifacts in 3D dental surface models. Artifact reduction should be taken into consideration for a proper diagnosis and treatment planning when using 3D surface model derived by CBCT in dentofacial deformity patients.","Wael Nabha,Young-Min Hong,Jin-Hyoung Cho,Hyeon-Shik Hwang","Artifact,Cone-beam computed tomography,Metallic restoration,Three-dimensional surface model."
Functional evaluation of orthopedic and orthodontic treatment in a patient with unilateral posterior crossbite and facial asymmetry.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24892028/,"An 8-years old boy with facial asymmetry and unilateral posterior crossbite on the left side received orthopedic and orthodontic treatment. During the first phase of treatment, the narrow maxillary arch was expanded using an acrylic plate. Then, the acrylic plate was used as a bite block with occlusal indentations from the construction bite that was obtained with the incisors in a coincident dental midline. After the position of the mandible was stabilized, the second phase of orthodontic treatment was initiated using fixed appliances for detailing of the occlusion. Skeletal symmetry, ideal occlusion, and coincident dental midlines were thus achieved.

Three-dimensional evaluation of midfacial asymmetry in patients with nonsyndromic unilateral cleft lip and palate by cone-beam computed tomography.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23814705/,"Objective:To compare three-dimensionally the midfacial hard- and soft-tissue asymmetries between the affected and the unaffected sides and determine the relationship between the hard tissue and the overlying soft tissue in patients with nonsyndromic complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) analysis. Methods:The maxillofacial regions of 26 adults (18 men, 8 women) with nonsyndromic UCLP were scanned by CBCT and reconstructed by three-dimensional dental imaging. The frontal-view midfacial analysis was based on a 3 × 3 grid of vertical and horizontal lines and their intersecting points. Two additional points were used for assessing the dentoalveolar area. Linear and surface measurements from three reference planes (Basion-perpendicular, midsagittal reference, and Frankfurt horizontal planes) to the intersecting points were used to evaluate the anteroposterior, transverse, and vertical asymmetries as well as convexity or concavity. Results:Anteroposteriorly, the soft tissue in the nasolabial and dentoalveolar regions was significantly thicker and positioned more anteriorly on the affected side than on the unaffected side (p < 0.05). The hard tissue in the dentoalveolar region was significantly retruded on the affected side compared with the unaffected side (p < 0.05). The other midfacial regions showed no significant differences. Conclusions:With the exception of the nasolabial and dentoalveolar regions, no distinctive midfacial hard- and soft-tissue asymmetries exist between the affected and the unaffected sides in patients with nonsyndromic UCLP.","Youn-Kyung Choi,Soo-Byung Park,Yong-Il Kim,Woo-Sung Son","Asymmetry,Cleft lip and palate,Computed tomography,Soft tissue."
"A comparative study of frictional force in self-ligating brackets according to the bracket-archwire angulation, bracket material, and wire type.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25667913/,"Objective:This study aimed to compare the frictional force (FR) in self-ligating brackets among different bracket-archwire angles, bracket materials, and archwire types. Methods:Passive and active metal self-ligating brackets and active ceramic self-ligating brackets were included as experimental groups, while conventional twin metal brackets served as a control group. All brackets were maxillary premolar brackets with 0.022 inch [in] slots and a -7° torque. The orthodontic wires used included 0.018 round and 0.019 × 0.025 in rectangular stainless steel wires. The FR was measured at 0°, 5°, and 10° angulations as the wire was drawn through the bracket slots after attaching brackets from each group to the universal testing machine. Static and kinetic FRs were also measured. Results:The passive self-ligating brackets generated a lower FR than all the other brackets. Static and kinetic FRs generally increased with an increase in the bracket-archwire angulation, and the rectangular wire caused significantly higher static and kinetic FRs than the round wire (p < 0.001). The metal passive self-ligating brackets exhibited the lowest static FR at the 0° angulation and a lower increase in static and kinetic FRs with an increase in bracket-archwire angulation than the other brackets, while the conventional twin brackets showed a greater increase than all three experimental brackets. Conclusions:The passive self-ligating brackets showed the lowest FR in this study. Self-ligating brackets can generate varying FRs in vitro according to the wire size, surface characteristics, and bracket-archwire angulation.","Souk Min Lee,Chung-Ju Hwang","Ceramic self-ligating bracket,Kinetic frictional force,Metal self-ligating bracket,Static frictional force."

He had low tongue posture positioned anteriorly at rest and during swallowing and reported chronic difficulty in nose breathing. Head cone-beam computed tomography revealed nasal septum deviation, right turbinate hypertrophy, and left maxillary sinus congestion, which were thought to contribute to the breathing problem, encourage the improper tongue posture, and thereby cause the relapse. Multidisciplinary treatment involving an otorhinolaryngologist, an orthodontist, and a periodontist resolved the upper airway obstruction and corrected the malocclusion.

Alveolar ridge expansion-assisted orthodontic space closure in the mandibular posterior region.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24396740/,"Orthodontic closure of old, edentulous spaces in the mandibular posterior region is a major challenge. In this report, we describe a method of orthodontic closure of edentulous spaces in the mandibular posterior region accelerated by piezoelectric decortication and alveolar ridge expansion. Combined piezosurgical and orthodontic treatments were used to close 14- and 15-mm-wide spaces in the mandibular left and right posterior areas, respectively, of a female patient, aged 18 years and 9 months, diagnosed with skeletal Class III malocclusion, hypodontia, and polydiastemas. After the piezoelectric decortication, segmental and full-arch mechanics were applied in the orthodontic phase. Despite some extent of root resorption and anchorage loss, the edentulous spaces were closed, and adequate function and esthetics were regained without further restorative treatment. Alveolar ridge expansion-assisted orthodontic space closure seems to be an effective and relatively less-invasive treatment alternative for edentulous spaces in the mandibular posterior region.","Mete Ozer,Berat Serdar Akdeniz,Mahmut Sumer","Adult treatment,Corticotomy,Orthodontic treatment,Tooth movement."

Methods:Interactive self-ligating brackets with closed and open slides were used for the self-ligating (SL) and conventional ligation (CL) groups, respectively; elastomeric ligatures (1 mm inner diameter) were used in the latter system. The alignment wire used was 0.014 inch heat-activated NiTi (austenitic finish temperature set at 36℃ by the manufacturer). A custom-made testing machine was used to measure frictional resistance. Tests were repeated 5 times at every angulation simulated. All data were analyzed statistically. Results:The RS increased significantly with increasing angulation in both SL and CL groups (p < 0.0001). However, the RS values were significantly higher at every angulation (p < 0.0001) in the CL group. Conclusions:Despite the relevance of the binding phenomenon, ligation forces predominantly affect the RS when low-stiffness alignment wires are used.","Giancarlo Cordasco,Antonino Lo Giudice,Angela Militi,Riccardo Nucera,Giuseppe Triolo,Giovanni Matarese","Bracket,Wire."

Comparison of the condyle-fossa relationship between skeletal class III malocclusion patients with and without asymmetry: a retrospective three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomograpy study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24228235/,"Objective:This study investigated whether temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condyle-fossa relationships are bilaterally symmetric in class III malocclusion patients with and without asymmetry and compared to those with normal occlusion. The hypothesis was a difference in condyle-fossa relationships exists in asymmetric patients. Methods:Group 1 comprised 40 Korean normal occlusion subjects. Groups 2 and 3 comprised patients diagnosed with skeletal class III malocclusion, who were grouped according to the presence of mandibular asymmetry: Group 2 included symmetric mandibles, while group 3 included asymmetric mandibles. Pretreatment three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (3D CBCT) images were obtained. Right- and left-sided TMJ spaces in groups 1 and 2 or deviated and non-deviated sides in group 3 were evaluated, and the axial condylar angle was compared. Results:The TMJ spaces demonstrated no significant bilateral differences in any group. Only group 3 had slightly narrower superior spaces (p < 0.001). The axial condylar angles between group 1 and 2 were not significant. However, group 3 showed a statistically significant bilateral difference (p < 0.001); toward the deviated side, the axial condylar angle was steeper. Conclusions:Even in the asymmetric group, the TMJ spaces were similar between deviated and non-deviated sides, indicating a bilateral condyle-fossa relationship in patients with asymmetry that may be as symmetrical as that in patients with symmetry. However, the axial condylar angle had bilateral differences only in asymmetric groups. The mean TMJ space value and the bilateral difference may be used for evaluating condyle-fossa relationships with CBCT.","Hyoun Oak Kim,Won Lee,Yoon-Ah Kook,Yoonji Kim","Class III diagnosis,Condyle-fossa relationship,Facial asymmetry,TMJ,Three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography."

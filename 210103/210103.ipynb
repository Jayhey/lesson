Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the craniofacial patterns of Korean children with snoring and adenotonsillar hypertrophy ( ATH ) could be categorized into characteristic clusters according to age. Methods : We enrolled 236 children with snoring and ATH ( age range , 5-12 years ) in this study. They were subdivided into four age groups : 5-6 , 7-8 , 9-10 , and 11-12 years. Based on cephalometric analysis , the sagittal and vertical skeletal patterns of each individual were divided into Class I , II , and III , as well as the normodivergent , hypodivergent , and hyperdivergent patterns , respectively. Cluster analysis was performed using cephalometric principal components in addition to the age factor. Results : Three heterogeneous clusters of craniofacial patterns were obtained in relation to age : cluster 1 ( 41.9 % ) included patients aged 5-8 years with a skeletal Class I or mild Class II and hyperdivergent pattern ; cluster 2 ( 45.3 % ) included patients aged 9-12 years with a Class II and hyperdivergent pattern ; and cluster 3 ( 12.8 % ) included patients aged 7-8 years with a Class III and hyperdivergent pattern. Conclusions : This study found that the craniofacial patterns of Korean children with snoring and ATH could be categorized into three characteristic clusters according to age groups. Although no significantly dominant sagittal skeletal discrepancy was observed , hyperdivergent vertical discrepancy was consistently evident in all clusters . Objective : To determine Korean facial profile preferences based on lip position as assessed by Hispanic-Americans of varying western adaptation levels and to determine whether the age and sex of the rater had any influence. Methods : For this study , 132 Hispanic-Americans and 68 Caucasians of varying age , sex and western adaptation levels volunteered to rate their preference of Korean male and female facial silhouettes having lips ranging from retruding to protruding. The Hispanic-Americans were also asked to complete a Bidimensional Acculturation Scale questionnaire to determine their western adaptation status : low-acculturated Hispanics ( LAH ; lesser western-adapted Hispanic participants ) or high-acculturated Hispanics ( HAH ; higher western-adapted Hispanic participants ) . Results : The LAHs preferred significantly more retruded lip positions ( p < 0.05 ) while HAHs showed some similarities with Caucasian participants in the results for the Korean male profile , even though HAHs preferred more retruded lip positions for the Korean female profile than Caucasians did ( p < 0.05 ) . The age and sex of raters did not influence the preference of facial profiles ( p > 0.05 ) . Conclusions : The results of this study suggest that Hispanic-Americans prefer a flatter Korean lip profile. It would be prudent for orthodontists to offer patients the option of altering lip profile through orthodontic and/or orthognathic surgery treatments . Objective : We sought to determine the predictors of midpalatal suture expansion by miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion ( MARPE ) in young adults. Methods : The following variables were selected as possible predictors : chronological age , palate length and depth , midpalatal suture maturation ( MPSM ) stage , midpalatal suture density ( MPSD ) ratio , the sella-nasion ( SN ) -mandibular plane ( MP ) angle as an indicator of the vertical skeletal pattern , and the point A-nasion-point B ( ANB ) angle for anteroposterior skeletal classification. For 31 patients ( mean age , 22.52 years ) who underwent MARPE treatment , palate length and depth , MPSM stage and MPSD ratio from the initial cone-beam computed tomography images , and the SN-MP angle and ANB angle from lateral cephalograms were assessed. The midpalatal suture opening ratio was calculated from the midpalatal suture opening width measured in periapical radiographs and the MARPE screw expansion. Statistical analyses of correlations were performed for the entire patient group of 31 subjects and subgroups categorized by sex , vertical skeletal pattern , and anteroposterior skeletal classification. Results : In the entire patient group , the midpalatal suture opening ratio showed statistically significant negative correlations with age , palate length , and MPSM stage ( r = -0.506 , -0.494 , and -0.746 , respectively , allp < 0.01 ) . In subgroup analyses , a strong negative correlation was observed with the palate depth in the skeletal Class II subgroup ( r = -0.900 , p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : The findings of this study indicated that age , palate length , and MPSM stage can be predictors of midpalatal suture expansion by MARPE in young adults . Objective : To develop a standardized instrument to measure the level of cognition for orthodontic treatment in adults , and verify its reliability and validity for assessing perceptions of orthodontic treatment in adults. Methods : A total of 406 adults aged 19-64 years were surveyed by an internet research system. A tool was developed through the instrument development and verification stages. The data were analyzed by correlation analysis , exploratory factor analysis , confirmatory factor analysis , and Cronbach 's α test. Results : The instrument consisted of 11 items covering four factors related to orthodontic treatment. Three items were related to general perception , four described the perception of the treatment for adults , two related to the treatment effects , and two related to the retention of orthodontic treatment. In the reliability test , Cronbach 's α was 0.845 for the 11 items. In assessments for individual components , Cronbach 's α was 0.764 for the general perception of orthodontic treatment , 0.705 for the perception of this treatment for adults , 0.707 for the effects of the treatment , and 0.701 for the retention of orthodontic treatment. Finally , a measurement instrument for the perception of orthodontic treatment in adults was designed to assess the 11 items on a four-point Likert scale. Conclusions : This study developed a standard measurement instrument for assessing the perception of orthodontic treatment in adults. The proposed instrument will enable additional studies on the influence of an adult 's perception of orthodontic treatment on the decision to undergo treatment . Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate the skeletal and dentoalveolar changes after miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion ( MARPE ) in young adults by cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) . Methods : This retrospective study included 14 patients ( mean age , 20.1 years ; range , 16-26 years ) with maxillary transverse deficiency treated with MARPE. Skeletal and dentoalveolar changes were evaluated using CBCT images acquired before and after expansion. Statistical analyses were performed using pairedt-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test according to normality of the data. Results : The midpalatal suture was separated , and the maxilla exhibited statistically significant lateral movement ( p < 0.05 ) after MARPE. Some of the landmarks had shifted forwards or upwards by a clinically irrelevant distance of less than 1 mm. The amount of expansion decreased in the superior direction , with values of 5.5 , 3.2 , 2.0 , and 0.8 mm at the crown , cementoenamel junction , maxillary basal bone , and zygomatic arch levels , respectively ( p < 0.05 ) . The buccal bone thickness and height of the alveolar crest had decreased by 0.6-1.1 mm and 1.7-2.2 mm , respectively , with the premolars and molars exhibiting buccal tipping of 1.1°-2.9°. Conclusions : Our results indicate that MARPE is an effective method for the correction of maxillary transverse deficiency without surgery in young adults . Objective : To investigate the dental phenotypes and treatment modalities ( Tx- Mod ) in Korean patients with Parry-Romberg syndrome ( PRS ) using longitudinal data. Methods : The samples consisted of 10 PRS patients , who were treated and/or followed-up at Seoul National University Dental Hospital between 1998 and 2019. Using a novel PRS severity index based on the numbers of the atrophy-involved area and asymmetry-involved item , we classified them into mild ( n = 3 ) , moderate ( n = 2 ) , and severe ( n = 5 ) . Dental phenotypes , including congenitally missing tooth ( Con-Missing-Tooth ) , microdontia , tooth with short root ( Short-Root ) , tooth with dilacerated root , and delayed eruption/impacted tooth , were investigated along with Tx-Mod. Results : The side of occurrence of all dental phenotypes showed 100 % concordance with the side of PRS involvement. The most two common dental phenotypes were Con-Missing- Tooth and Short-Root ( n = 29 and n = 17 in six patients ) . The sums of the average number of Con-Missing-Tooth and Short-Root increased from mild PRS to moderate PRS and severe PRS cases ( 1.0 , 6.0 , and 6.2 ) . In terms of Tx- Mod , growth observation due to mild atrophy , fixed orthodontic treatment , and grafting were used for mild PRS cases. Tx-Mod for moderate PRS cases involved growth observation for surgery due to an early age at the initial visit. For severe PRS cases , diverse Tx-Mod combinations including unilateral functional appliance , fixed orthodontic treatment , growth observation , grafting , and orthognathic surgery were used. Conclusions : The novel PRS severity index may be useful to provide primary data for individualized diagnosis and treatment planning for PRS patients . Objective : Miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion ( MARPE ) is a means for expanding the basal bone without surgical intervention in young adults. Here , we assessed the differences in dental , alveolar , and skeletal measurements taken before ( T0 ) , immediately after ( T1 ) , and 1 year after ( T2 ) MARPE. Methods : Twenty-four patients ( mean age , 21.6 years ) who had undergone MARPE and cone-beam computed tomography at T0 , T1 , and T2 were included. Changes in the following parameters were compared using pairedt-tests : intercusp , interapex , alveolar , nasal floor , and nasal cavity widths ; inclination of the first molar ( M1 ) and its alveolus ; and thickness and height of the alveolar bone. A linear mixed-effects model was used to determine variables that affected periodontal changes in the M1. Results : MARPE produced significant increases in most measurements during T0-T2 , despite relapse of some measurements during T1-T2. The alveolar thickness decreased on the buccal side , but increased on the palatal side. The alveolar crest level at the first premolar moved apically. Changes in the thickness and height of the alveolar bone were affected by the corresponding initial values. Conclusions : MARPE can be used as an effective tool for correcting maxillomandibular transverse discrepancy , showing stable outcomes 1 year after expansion . Resistance to sliding ( RS ) between the bracket , wire , and ligature has been largely debated in orthodontics. Despite the extensive number of published studies , the lack of discussion of the methods used has led to little understanding of this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to discuss variables affecting RS in orthodontics and to suggest an operative protocol. The search included PubMed© , Medline© , and the Cochrane Library©. References of full-text articles were manually analyzed. English-language articles published between January 2007 and January 2017 that performed anin vitroanalysis of RS between the bracket , wire , and ligature were included. Study methods were analyzed based on the study design , description of materials , and experimental setup , and a protocol to standardize the testing methods was proposed. From 404 articles identified from the database search and 242 records selected from published references , 101 were eligible for the qualitative analysis , and six for the quantitative synthesis. One or more experimental parameters were incompatible and a meta-analysis was not performed. Major factors regarding the study design , materials , and experimental setup were not clearly described by most studies. The normal force , that is the force perpendicular to the sliding of the wire and one of the most relevant variable in RS , was not considered by most studies. Different variables were introduced , often acting as confounding factors. A protocol was suggested to standardize testing procedures and enhance the understanding ofin vitrofindings . Objective : To investigate the prevalence of malocclusion with respect to grade , sex , and year among Korean pre-adolescent and adolescent students during 2012-2017. Methods : A total of 165,996 students ( first grade [ E1 , 6-7 years of age ] , fourth grade [ E4 , 9-10 years ] , seventh grade [ M1 , 12-13 years ] , and tenth grade [ H1 , 15-16 years ] ) were selected by stratified sampling method and underwent the nationwide oral health examination performed by the Ministry of Education , Republic of Korea. The malocclusion assessments based on dentists ' judgments were `` no malocclusion , '' `` needs orthodontic treatment ( N-OTx ) , '' and `` under orthodontic treatment ( U-OTx ) . '' The sum of N-OTx and U-OTx cases was determined as the number of students with malocclusion. After analyzing the prevalence of malocclusion according to grade , sex , and year-by-year differences , Pearson correlation analyses and two-way analyses of variance were performed. Results : The prevalence of malocclusion was 18.7 % , which increased with the grades ( E1 [ 8.3 % ] < E4 [ 15.8 % ] < M1 [ 22.9 % ] < H1 [ 25.3 % ] , p < 0.001 ) . However , there was no significant difference in the prevalence of malocclusion in each grade group for the period ( p > 0.05 ) without significant correlation ( E1 , = 0.129 ; E4 , = -0.495 ; M1 , = 0.406 ; H1 , = -0.383 ; allp > 0.05 ) . The prevalence of malocclusion within each grade group over the six-year period was more prominent in the female ( p < 0.0001 ) . Conclusions : Further studies are necessary to modify the malocclusion assessment method to account for specific types of malocclusion in pre-adolescent and adolescent students . Objective : The Heat Induction Typodont System ( HITS ) , used in some recent studies , has a distinct advantage over previous tooth movement simulation methods. This study aimed to compare inclination and vertical changes between the single-wire and double-wire techniques duringen masseretraction with different lengths of lever arms in lingual orthodontics using an upgraded version of the HITS. Methods : Duet lingual brackets , which have two main slots , were used in this study. Forty samples were divided into four groups according to the length of the lever arm ( 3-mm or 6-mm hook ) and the retraction wire ( single-wire or double-wire ) . Four millimeters ofen masseretraction was performed using lingual appliances. Thereafter , 3-dimensional-scanned images of the typodont were analyzed to measure inclination and vertical changes of the anterior teeth. Results : Incisor inclination presented more changes in the single-wire groups than in the double-wire groups. However , canine inclination did not differ between these groups. Regarding vertical changes , only the lateral incisors in the single-wire groups presented significantly larger values than did those in the double-wire groups. Combining the effect of hook lengths , among the four groups , the single-wire group with the 3-mm hook had the highest value , while the double-wire group with the 6-mm hook showed the least decrease in crown inclination and extrusion. Conclusions : The double-wire technique with an extended lever arm provided advantages over the single-wire technique with the same lever arm length in preventing torque loss and extrusion of the anterior teeth duringen masseretraction in lingual orthodontics . Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate the stress distribution and displacement of various craniofacial structures after nonsurgical rapid palatal expansion ( RPE ) with conventional ( C-RPE ) , bone-borne ( B-RPE ) , and miniscrew-assisted ( MARPE ) expanders for young adults using three-dimensional finite element analysis ( 3D FEA ) . Methods : Conventional , bone-borne , and miniscrew-assisted palatal expanders were designed to simulate expansion in a 3D FE model created from a 20-year-old human dry skull. Stress distribution and the displacement pattern for each circumaxillary suture and anchor tooth were calculated. Results : The results showed that C-RPE induced the greatest stress along the frontal process of the maxilla and around the anchor teeth , followed by the suture area , whereas B-RPE generated the greatest stress around the miniscrew , although the area was limited within the suture. Compared with the other appliances , MARPE caused relatively even stress distribution , decreased the stress on the buccal plate of the anchor teeth , and reduced tipping of the anchor teeth. Conclusions : The findings of this study suggest that the incorporation of miniscrews in RPE devices may contribute to force delivery to the sutures and a decrease in excessive stress on the buccal plate. Thus , MARPE may serve as an effective modality for the nonsurgical treatment of transverse maxillary deficiency in young adults . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in three-dimensional ( 3D ) morphology of the hard palate between Korean adults with and without mild-to-moderate obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) using cone-beam computed tomographic ( CBCT ) data. Methods : The protocol for the two-dimensional ( 2D ) and 3D mathematical modeling was established by analyzing CBCT images of 30 adults with OSA and 30 matched controls without OSA , using MIMICS software. The linear and angular measurements were also determined using this software. The measurements were repeated for 30 palates , by the same operator , to assess reliability. Results : The palates of OSA patients were higher in the posterior part and narrower in the anterior-superior part than those of the control group ( p < 0.05 ) . The nasal cavities of patients with OSA were narrower ( p < 0.05 ) than those of controls. The increasing angle of the first molar palatal root is a compensation of the upper dental arch to improve occlusion. However , for most palatal measurements , there were no significant differences between the OSA and control groups ( p > 0.05 ) . The results of 2D and 3D mathematical models were consistent for linear and angular measurements , indicating that 2D and 3D mathematical modeling of the palate is a reliable methodology. Conclusions : OSA is a multifactorial disease ; the palates of adults with mild-to-moderate OSA do not have specific morphological features distinct from those of healthy controls . Forces and moments delivered by a straight wire connecting two orthodontic brackets are statically indeterminate and can not be estimated using the classical equations of static equilibrium. To identify the mechanics of such two-bracket systems , Burstone and Koenig used the principles of linear beam theory to estimate the resulting force systems. In the original publication , however , it remains unclear how the force systems were calculated because no reference or computational details on the underlying principles have been provided. Using the moment carry-over principle and the relative angulation of the brackets , a formula was derived to calculate the relative moments of the two brackets. Because of the moment equilibrium , the vertical forces that exist as a forcecouple on the two brackets can also be calculated. The accuracy of the proposed approach can be validated using previously published empirical data . Objective : This study was aimed at comparing the mandibular arch forms of Korean and Vietnamese patients by using facial axis ( FA ) points on three-dimensional ( 3D ) models. Methods : Mandibular casts of 68 Korean ( Class I malocclusion , 30 ; Class II malocclusion , 38 ) and 78 Vietnamese ( Class I malocclusion , 41 ; Class II malocclusion , 37 ) patients were scanned in their occluded positions and grouped according to arch form ( tapered , ovoid , and square ) . The FA point of each tooth was digitized on the 3D mandibular models. The measurements and frequency distributions of the arch forms were compared between the ethnic groups. Results : The Vietnamese patients had significantly greater intercanine depth and intercanine and intermolar width-to-depth ratios than the Korean patients ( p < 0.05 ) . The frequency distributions of the arch forms were also significantly different ( p = 0.038 ) , but no sexual dimorphism was found. Conclusions : Vietnamese people tend to have deeper and wider arches than Korean people. The three arch forms are evenly distributed in Korean people , but Vietnamese people frequently have square arches. Clinicians should identify the correct arch form of an ethnic group before initiating orthodontic treatment . Objective : This study aimed to identify possible risk factors for external apical root resorption ( EARR ) in the maxillary incisors after orthodontic treatment. Methods : The root length of 2,173 maxillary incisors was measured on periapical radiographs of 564 patients who received orthodontic treatment. The Kappa test was performed to evaluate intraexaminer and interexaminer reproducibility. Multiple binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between EARR and various factors. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were reported. Results : The risk of developing EARR was 70 % higher in orthodontic treatment with maxillary premolar extraction ( p= 0.004 ) , 58 % higher in patients with increased overjet ( p= 0.012 ) , 41 % lower in two-phase orthodontic treatment ( p= 0.037 ) , and 33 % lower in patients with deep bite ( p= 0.039 ) . The lateral incisors were 54 % more likely to develop EARR ( p < 0.001 ) , dilacerated roots were 2.26 times more likely to develop EARR ( p < 0.001 ) , and for each additional millimeter of root length , the risk of EARR increased by 29 % ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : The potential risk factors for EARR after orthodontic treatment included treatment with maxillary premolar extraction , increased overjet at the beginning of treatment , and dilacerated roots . [ This corrects the article on p. 3 in vol. 48 , PMID : 29291183. ] . Objective : The aim of this study was to investigate the three-dimensional ( 3D ) position of the center of resistance of 4 mandibular anterior teeth , 6 mandibular anterior teeth , and the complete mandibular dentition by using 3D finite-element analysis. Methods : Finite-element models included the complete mandibular dentition , periodontal ligament , and alveolar bone. The crowns of teeth in each group were fixed with buccal and lingual arch wires and lingual splint wires to minimize individual tooth movement and to evenly disperse the forces onto the teeth. Each group of teeth was subdivided into 0.5-mm intervals horizontally and vertically , and a force of 200 g was applied on each group. The center of resistance was defined as the point where the applied force induced parallel movement. Results : The center of resistance of the 4 mandibular anterior teeth group was 13.0 mm apical and 6.0 mm posterior , that of the 6 mandibular anterior teeth group was 13.5 mm apical and 8.5 mm posterior , and that of the complete mandibular dentition group was 13.5 mm apical and 25.0 mm posterior to the incisal edge of the mandibular central incisors. Conclusions : Finite-element analysis was useful in determining the 3D position of the center of resistance of the 4 mandibular anterior teeth group , 6 mandibular anterior teeth group , and complete mandibular dentition group . Objective : To investigate the distribution and phenotypes of hemifacial microsomia ( HFM ) and its association with other anomalies. Methods : This study included 249 Korean patients with HFM , whose charts , photographs , radiographs , and/or computed tomography scans acquired during 1998-2018 were available from Seoul National University Hospital and Dental Hospital. Prevalence according to sex , side involvement , degree of mandibular deformity , compensatory growth of the mandibular body , and Angle 's classification , and its association with other anomalies were statistically analyzed. Results : Prevalence was not different between male and female patients ( 55.0 % vs. 45.0 % , p > 0.05 ) . Unilateral HFM ( UHFM ) was more prevalent than bilateral HFM ( BHFM ) ( 86.3 % vs. 13.7 % , p < 0.001 ) . Although distribution of the Pruzansky-Kaban types differed significantly in patients with UHFM ( I , 53.0 % ; IIa , 18.6 % ; IIb , 24.7 % ; III , 3.7 % ; p < 0.001 ) , no difference was observed in occurrence between the right and left sides ( 52.6 % vs. 47.4 % , p > 0.05 ) . Among patients with BHFM , prevalence of different Pruzansky-Kaban types on the right and left sides was greater than that of the same type on both sides ( 67.6 % vs. 32.4 % , p < 0.05 ) . Despite hypoplasia of the condyle/ramus complex , compensatory growth of the mandibular body on the ipsilateral side occurred in 35 patients ( 14.1 % ) . Class I and II molar relationships were more prevalent than Class III molar relationships ( 93.2 % vs. 6.8 % , p < 0.001 ) . Forty-eight patients ( 19.3 % ) had other anomalies , with 50.0 % and 14.4 % in the BHFM and UHFM groups ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : Patients with HFM require individualized diagnosis and treatment planning because of diverse phenotypes and associations with other anomalies . Objective : A national survey was conducted to assess orthodontic residents ' current concepts and knowledge of cleft lip and palate ( CLP ) management in Korea. Methods : A questionnaire consisting of 7 categories and 36 question items was distributed to 16 senior chief residents of orthodontic department at 11 dental university hospitals and 5 medical university hospitals in Korea. All respondents completed the questionnaires and returned them. Results : All of the respondents reported that they belonged to an interdisciplinary team. Nineteen percent indicated that they use presurgical infant orthopedic ( PSIO ) appliances. The percentage of respondents who reported they were 'unsure ' about the methods about for cleft repair operation method was relatively high. Eighty-six percent reported that the orthodontic treatment was started at the deciduous or mixed dentition. Various answers were given regarding the amount of maxillary expansion for alveolar bone graft and the estimates of spontaneous or forced eruption of the upper canine. Sixty-seven percent reported use of a rapid maxillary expansion appliance as an anchorage device for maxillary protraction with a facemask. There was consensus among respondents regarding daily wearing time , duration of treatment , and amount of orthopedic force. Various estimates were given for the relapse percentage after maxillary advancement distraction osteogenesis ( MADO ) . Most respondents did not have sufficient experience with MADO. Conclusions : These findings suggest that education about the concepts and methods of PSIO and surgical repair , consensus regarding orthodontic management protocols , and additional MADO experience are needed in order to improve the quality of CLP management in Korean orthodontic residents . The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness and complications of corticotomy and piezocision in canine retraction. Five electronic databases ( PubMed , SCOPUS , Web of Science , Embase , and CENTRAL ) were searched for articles published up to July 2017. The databases were searched for randomized control trials ( RCTs ) , with a split-mouth design , using either corticotomy or piezocision. The primary outcome reported for canine retraction was either the amount of tooth movement , rate of tooth movement , or treatment time. The secondary outcome was complications. The selection process was based on the PRISMA guidelines. A risk of bias assessment was also performed. Our search retrieved 530 abstracts. However , only five RCTs were finally included. Corticotomy showed a more significant ( i.e. , 2 to 4 times faster ) increase in the rate of tooth movement than did the conventional method. For piezocision , both accumulative tooth movement and rate of tooth movement were twice faster than those of the conventional method. Corticotomy ( with a flap design avoiding marginal bone incision ) or flapless piezocision procedures were not detrimental to periodontal health. Nevertheless , piezocision resulted in higher levels of patient satisfaction. The main limitation of this study was the limited number of primary research publications on both techniques. For canine retraction into the immediate premolar extraction site , the rate of canine movement after piezocision was almost comparable to that of corticotomy with only buccal flap elevation . Objective : The aims of this study were to investigate a simple method for assessing anterior-posterior jaw relationships via cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images taken in the natural head position ( NHP ) relative to the nasion true vertical plane ( NTVP ) , and measure normative data in Korean adults with normal profiles. Methods : Subjects were selected from patients presenting for third molar extraction and evaluated as having normal profiles by three examiners. The CBCT images of 80 subjects ( 39 males , 41 females ) were taken in the NHP according to Solow and Tallgren 's method. Linear measurements of the A-point , B-point , and Pog were calculated relative to the NTVP. Student 's t-test was used to assess sexual differences in these measurements. Results : The mean linear measurements of the A-point , B-point , and Pog relative to the NTVP were 0.18 mm ( standard deviation [ SD ] , 4.77 mm ) , -4.00 mm ( SD , 6.62 mm ) , and -2.49 mm ( SD , 7.14 mm ) respectively in Korean males , and 1.48 mm ( SD , 4.21 mm ) , -4.07 mm ( SD , 6.70 mm ) and -2.91 mm ( SD , 7.25 mm ) in Korean females respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between Korean males and females ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Three-dimensional CBCT analysis using the NTVP is a simple and reliable method for assessing anterior-posterior skeletal relationships . Objective : The aim of this finite element study was to clarify the mechanics of tooth movement in palatalen-masseretraction of segmented maxillary anterior teeth by using anchor screws and lever arms. Methods : A three-dimensional finite element method was used to simulate overall orthodontic tooth movements. The line of action of the force was varied by changing both the lever arm height and anchor screw position. Results : When the line of action of the force passed through the center of resistance ( CR ) , the anterior teeth showed translation. However , when the line of action was not perpendicular to the long axis of the anterior teeth , the anterior teeth moved bodily with an unexpected intrusion even though the force was transmitted horizontally. To move the anterior teeth bodily without intrusion and extrusion , a downward force passing through the CR was necessary. When the line of action of the force passed apical to the CR , the anterior teeth tipped counterclockwise during retraction , and when the line of action of the force passed coronal to the CR , the anterior teeth tipped clockwise during retraction. Conclusions : The movement pattern of the anterior teeth changed depending on the combination of lever arm height and anchor screw position. However , this pattern may be unpredictable in clinical settings because the movement direction is not always equal to the force direction . Objective : This retrospective , cross-sectional study aimed to establish reference data for normal crown and root lengths and the root-crown ratios ( R/C ratios ) for the mature maxillary and mandibular incisors in a Korean population by using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) . Methods : We included 672 Korean patients ( 141 men and 531 women ; mean age , 27.2 ± 7.7 years ) who underwent CBCT examinations during various dental treatments. Crown and root lengths and the R/C ratios of the maxillary and mandibular incisors were measured using CBCT data , which were analyzed to detect significant differences between demographic factors as well as sagittal and vertical skeletal or occlusal relationships. Results : Teeth of the same type in each half-arch were symmetrical. The mean R/C ratios varied from 1.1 to 1.2 for the maxillary incisors and from 1.3 to 1.4 for the mandibular incisors. Crown and root lengths were greater in men than in women , regardless of tooth type. Root lengths and R/C ratios for the mandibular incisors were significantly greater in patients with skeletal Class II malocclusion or an excessive overjet than in the other patients. The R/C ratios for the mandibular incisors were lower in patients with an open bite than in those with a normal or deep bite. Moreover , the R/C ratios for the mandibular incisors increased with age. Conclusions : The data obtained in our study can serve as reference values for crown and root lengths and the R/C ratios for the maxillary and mandibular incisors in the Korean population . Objective : The objective of this study was to develop new parameters based on the foramina of the trigeminal nerve and to compare them with the conventional cephalometric parameters in different facial skeletal types. Methods : Cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) scans and cephalograms from 147 adult patients ( 57 males and 90 females ; mean age , 26.1 years ) were categorized as Class I ( 1° < ANB < 3° ) , Class II ( ANB > 5° ) , and Class III ( ANB < -1° ) . Seven foramina in the craniofacial area-foramen rotundum ( Rot ) , foramen ovale ( Ov ) , infraorbital foramen , greater palatine foramen , incisive foramen ( IF ) , mandibular foramen ( MDF ) , and mental foramen ( MTF ) -were identified in the CBCT images. Various linear , angular , and ratio parameters were compared between the groups by using the foramina , and the relationship between the new parameters and the conventional cephalometric parameters was assessed. Results : The distances between the foramina in the cranial base did not differ among the three groups. However , the Rot-IF length was shorter in female Class III patients , while the Ov-MTF length , MDF-MTF length , and Ov-MDF length were shorter in Class II patients than in Class III patients of both sexes. The MDF-MTF/FH plane angle was larger in Class II patients than in Class III patients of both sexes. Most parameters showed moderate to high correlations , but the Ov-MDF-MTF angle showed a relatively low correlation with the gonial angle. Conclusions : The foramina of the trigeminal nerve can be used to supplement assessments based on the conventional skeletal landmarks on CBCT images . Objective : To investigate the distribution , side involvement , phenotype , and associated anomalies of Korean patients with craniofacial clefts ( CFC ) . Methods : The samples consisted of 38 CFC patients , who were treated at Seoul National University Dental Hospital during 1998-2018. The Tessier cleft type , sex , side involvement , phenotype , and associated anomalies were investigated using nonparametric statistical analysis. Results : The three most common types were # 7 cleft , followed by # 0 cleft and # 14 cleft. There was no difference between the frequency of male and female. Patients with # 0 cleft exhibited nasal deformity , bony defect , and missing teeth in the premaxilla , midline cleft lip , and eye problems. A patient with # 3 cleft ( unilateral type ) exhibited bilateral cleft lip and alveolus. All patients with # 4 cleft were the bilateral type , including a combination of # 3 and # 4 clefts , and had multiple missing teeth. A patient with # 5 cleft ( unilateral type ) had a posterior openbite. In patients with # 7 cleft , the unilateral type was more prevalent than the bilateral type ( 87.0 % vs. 13.0 % , p < 0.001 ) . Sixteen patients showed hemifacial microsomia ( HFM ) , Goldenhar syndrome , and unilateral cleft lip and palate ( UCLP ) . There was a significant match in the side involvement of # 7 cleft and HFM ( 87.5 % , p < 0.01 ) . Patients with # 14 cleft had plagiocephaly , UCLP , or hyperterorbitism. A patient with # 30 cleft exhibited tongue tie and missing tooth. Conclusions : Due to the diverse associated craniofacial anomalies in patients with CFC , a multidisciplinary approach involving a well-experienced cooperative team is mandatory for these patients . Objective : The aim of this systematic review was to assess the occlusal outcome and duration of fixed orthodontic therapy from clinical trials in humans with the Objective Grading System ( OGS ) proposed by the American Board of Orthodontics. Methods : Nine databases were searched up to October 2016 for prospective/retrospective clinical trials assessing the outcomes of orthodontic therapy with fixed appliances. After duplicate study selection , data extraction , and risk of bias assessment according to the Cochrane guidelines , random-effects meta-analyses of the mean OGS score and treatment duration were performed and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated. Results : A total of 34 relevant clinical trials including 6,207 patients ( 40 % male , 60 % female ; average age , 18.4 years ) were identified. The average OGS score after treatment was 27.9 points ( 95 % CI , 25.3-30.6 points ) , while the average treatment duration was 24.9 months ( 95 % CI , 24.6-25.1 months ) . There was no significant association between occlusal outcome and treatment duration , while considerable heterogeneity was identified. In addition , orthodontic treatment involving extraction of four premolars appeared to have an important effect on both outcomes and duration of treatment. Finally , only 10 ( 39 % ) of the identified studies matched compared groups by initial malocclusion severity , although meta-epidemiological evidence suggested that matching may have significantly influenced their results. Conclusions : The findings from this systematic review suggest that the occlusal outcomes of fixed appliance treatment vary considerably , with no significant association between treatment outcomes and duration. Prospective matched clinical studies that use the OGS tool are needed to compare the effectiveness of orthodontic appliances . Objective : This study aimed to analyze the effect of changing various parameters of the bone-borne rapid palatal expander ( RPE ) using the finite element method ( FEM ) . Methods : In eight experimental groups , we investigated the effect of the number , position , and length of miniscrews ; positional changes of the expander ; and changes in the hook length on maxillary expansion. In finite element analysis , we compared the magnitude and distribution of stress , and the displacement changes following expansion of the bone-borne RPE. Results : When we compared the number and position of miniscrews , placing miniscrews in the anterior and posterior sides was advantageous for maxillary expansion in terms of stress distribution and displacement changes. Miniscrew length did not significantly affect stress distribution and displacement changes. Furthermore , anteroposterior displacement of the expander did not significantly affect transverse maxillary expansion but had various effects on vertical changes of the maxilla. The maxilla rotated clockwise when the miniscrews were placed in the anterior region. The hook length of the expander did not show consistent results in terms of changes in stress distribution and magnitude or in displacement changes. Conclusions : The findings of this study suggest that changes in the location and length of the miniscrews and displacement of the bone-borne RPE could affect the pattern of the maxillary expansion , depending on the combination of these factors . Objective : To investigate the effects of reversing the coiling direction of nickeltitanium closed-coil springs ( NiTi-CCSs ) on the force-deflection characteristics. Methods : The samples consisted of two commercially available conventional NiTi-CCS groups and two reverse-wound NiTi-CCS groups ( Ormco-Conventional vs. Ormco-Reverse ; GAC-Conventional vs. GAC-Reverse ; n = 20 per group ) . The reverse-wound NiTi-CCSs were directly made from the corresponding conventional NiTi-CCSs by reversing the coiling direction. Tensile tests were performed for each group in a temperature-controlled acrylic chamber ( 37 ± 1 ) . After measuring the force level , the range of the deactivation force plateau ( DFP ) and the amount of mechanical hysteresis ( MH ) , statistical analyses were performed. Results : The Ormco-Reverse group exhibited a significant shift of the DFP end point toward the origin point ( 2.3 to 0.6 mm ) , an increase in the force level ( 1.2 to 1.3 N ) and amount of MH ( 1.0 to 1.5 N ) compared to the Ormco-Conventional group ( allp < 0.001 ) , which indicated that force could be constantly maintained until the end of the deactivation curve. In contrast , the GAC-Reverse group exhibited a significant shift of the DFP-end point away from the origin point ( 0.2 to 3.3 mm ) , a decrease in the force level ( 1.1 to 0.9 N ) and amount of MH ( 0.6 to 0.4 N ) compared to the GAC-Conventional group ( allp < 0.001 ) , which may hinder the maintenance of force until the end of the deactivation curve. Conclusions : The two commercially available NiTi-CCS groups exhibited different patterns of change in the force-deflection characteristics when the coiling direction was reversed . Objective : The aims of this study were to assess the direction and degree of lip-line cant in Korean adult orthodontic patients and to identify the effects of sex and age on changes in the cant severity. Methods : In this cross-sectional retrospective study , lip-line cant was measured in the frontal photographs of 585 Korean patients ( 92 men and 493 women ) aged 18-48 years. The outcome variables ( direction and degree of lip-line cant ) were assessed in terms of predictor variables ( sex , age , sagittal skeletal relationship , and menton deviation angle ) . Results : The direction of lip-line cant did not differ according to sex , age , or skeletal classification. Patients had 1.6° of lip-line cant on average before orthodontic treatment. Middle-aged adults displayed a significant trend toward a lower degree of lip-line cant compared to younger adults ( p < 0.01 ) . Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the degree of lip-line cant was weakly negatively correlated with age ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : While the direction of lip-line cant did not differ according to the parameters explored here , the degree of cant was correlated with age in adults , independent of menton deviation. Specifically , middle-aged adults tended to display significantly lower degrees of lip-line cant than did younger adults . Objective : To evaluate the relationship of gingival thickness ( GT ) and the width of keratinized gingiva ( WKG ) with different malocclusion groups and the level of crowding. Methods : A total of 187 periodontally healthy subjects ( 121 females and 66 males ) who presented at the Faculty of Dentistry in Yüzüncü Yıl University for orthodontic treatment were enrolled in the study. The individuals involved in the study were divided into three groups ; Angle Class I malocclusion , Angle Class II malocclusion , and Angle Class III malocclusion. Each group was classified as mild , moderate , or severe according to the level of crowding. WKG was determined as the distance between the mucogingival junction and the free gingival margin. GT was determined by the transgingival probing technique. Factorial variance analysis and the Duncan multiple comparison test were employed to identify the extent to which a difference was apparent between the groups according to these parameters. Results : It was determined that teeth in the mandibular anterior region display the thin gingival biotype. WKG and GT were observed as being higher at the mandibular incisor teeth in the severe crowding group and at the mandibular canine teeth in the mild crowding group. The GT of the mandibular right central and lateral incisors was found to be thinner in the Angle Class III group. Conclusions : Within the limits of this study , the results demonstrate that , there is no significant relationship of WKG and the mean GT in the mandibular anterior region according to the Angle classification . Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate retention practices commonly employed by orthodontists. The objectives were to identify the types of retainer frequently used and to investigate the variations in retention practice. Methods : A total of 97 orthodontists were randomly selected , and a questionnaire consisting of 25 multiple-choice questions sent to them by mail. Upon receiving of the completed questionnaires , the data were statistically analyzed. Results : A total of 32 responses were received ; among these , 59.4 % of orthodontists ' practiced is in a government setting and 40.6 % were in private practice. A vacuum-formed retainer was the most commonly used removable retainer for both maxillary ( 46.9 % ) and mandibular ( 46.9 % ) arches , followed by a Hawley retainer ( maxilla , 43.8 % ; mandible , 37.5 % ) , and a fixed retainer ( maxilla , 3.1 % ; mandible , 9.4 % ) . Of the responding orthodontists , 78.1 % prescribed full-time wear ( more than 20 h per day ) for a duration of 3-9 months for a maxillary arch , compared to 71.9 % for the mandibular arch. Only 18.8 % of the orthodontists prescribed part-time wear of the retainer for the maxillary arch , compared to 21.9 % for the mandibular arch. The majority of orthodontists did not instruct their patients to stop wearing removable retainers ( 71.9 % ) or fixed retainers ( 66.8 % ) at any specific time and they preferred their patients to continue wearing retainers. Conclusions : Vacuum-formed retainers are the most commonly used retainers among orthodontists. The majority of orthodontists prescribed full-time wear for more than 20 h per day with a duration of 3-9 months and preferred indefinite use of the retainer . Objective : This study aimed to analyze the correlation of horizontal and sagittal planes used in two-dimensional diagnosis with lip canting by using threedimensional ( 3D ) analysis. Methods : Fifty-two patients ( 25 men , 27 women ; average age : 24 years ) undergoing treatment for dentofacial deformity were enrolled. Computed tomography images were acquired , and digital imaging and communication in medicine files were reconstructed into a 3D virtual model wherein horizontal and sagittal craniofacial planes were measured. Subsequently , the correlations of lip canting with these horizontal and sagittal planes were investigated. Results : The mandibular symmetry plane , the occlusal plane , Camper 's plane , the mandibular plane , Broadbent 's plane , and the nasal axis plane were correlated with the amount of lip canting ( Pearson 's correlation coefficients : 0.761 , 0.648 , 0.556 , 0.526 , 0.438 , and 0.406 , respectively ) . Planes associated with the lower part of the face showed the strongest correlations ; the strength of the correlations decreased in the midfacial and cranial regions. None of the planes showed statistically significant differences between patients with clinical lip canting ( > 3° ) and those without prominent lip canting. Conclusions : The findings of this study suggest that lip canting is strongly correlated with the mandibular symmetry plane , which includes menton deviation. This finding may have clinical implications with regard to the treatment of patients requiring correction of lip canting. Further studies are necessary for evaluating changes in lip canting after orthognathic surgery . Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate the amount of tooth movement and histologic changes with different corticotomy designs and micro-osteoperforation in rabbits. Methods : The sample consisted of 24 rabbits divided into three experimental groups ( triangular corticotomy [ TC ] and indentation corticotomy [ IC ] with flap , and flapless micro-osteoperforations [ MP ] ) and a control. A traction force of 100 cN was applied by connecting the first premolars to the incisors. The amount of tooth movement was measured. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to assess differences in tooth movement between the groups. Micro-computed tomography , hematoxylin and eosin staining , and tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase ( TRAP ) analysis were performed. Analysis of variance was applied to assess differences in TRAP-positive osteoclast count between the groups. Results : The amount of tooth movement increased by 46.5 % and 32.0 % in the IC and MP groups , respectively , while the bone fraction analysis showed 69.7 % and 8.5 % less mineralization compared to the control. There were no significant intergroup differences in the number of TRAP-positive osteoclasts. Conclusions : The micro-osteoperforation group showed no significant differences in the amount of tooth movement compared to the corticotomy groups , nor in the TRAP-positive osteoclast count compared to both corticotomy groups and control . Objective : This study aimed to investigate the effect of pre-applied orthodontic force on the regeneration of periodontal ligament ( PDL ) tissues and the underlying mechanisms in tooth replantation. Methods : Orthodontic force ( 50 cN ) was applied to the left maxillary first molars of 7-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats ( n = 32 ) ; the right maxillary first molars were left untreated to serve as the control group. After 7 days , the first molars on both sides were fully luxated and were immediately replanted in their original sockets. To verify the effects of the pre-applied orthodontic force , we assessed gene expression by using microarray analysis and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , cell proliferation by using proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) immunofluorescence staining , and morphological changes by using histological analysis. Results : Application of orthodontic force for 7 days led to the proliferation of PDL tissues , as verified on microarray analysis and PCNA staining. Histological analysis after replantation revealed less root resorption , a better arrangement of PDL fibers , and earlier regeneration of periodontal tissues in the experimental group than in the control group. For the key genes involved in periodontal tissue remodeling , includingCXCL2 , CCL4 , CCL7 , MMP3 , PCNA , OPG , andRUNX2 , quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that messenger RNA levels were higher at 1 or 2 weeks in the experimental group. Conclusions : These results suggest that the application of orthodontic force prior to tooth replantation enhanced the proliferation and activities of PDL cells and may lead to higher success rates with fewer complications . Objective : The aim of this study was to translate the Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire ( PIDAQ ) into Turkish , validate the questionnaire , and provide a cross-cultural adaptation. Methods : The translation process included the following steps , which were performed by a translation committee : ( 1 ) translation into Turkish , ( 2 ) back translation into English , ( 3 ) pretesting , and ( 4 ) cross-cultural adaptation. The Turkish version of the PIDAQ was produced subsequent to the translation process. Validity and reliability were measured using the Perception of Occlusion Scale and the aesthetic component of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need. The questionnaire was administered to 260 individuals ( age range , 18-30 years ; mean age , 20.50 ± 1.9 years ) . Structural validity was assessed via factor analysis , and internal consistency was measured using Cronbach 's alpha coefficient. Results : Factor analysis revealed a four-factor structure , with factor loadings for included items ranging from 0.380 to 0.868. Few questions were shuffled among domains various factor loadings. Cronbach 's alphas for the Turkish version of the PIDAQ ranged from 0.534 to 0.904. Mean scores for the PIDAQ subscale and total scores differed significantly according to Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need and Perception of Occlusion Scale scores. Conclusions : This study provided a Turkish version of the PIDAQ , which could be a useful tool in the evaluation of the psychosocial impact of malocclusion in young Turkish adults . Objective : Teeth discoloration is a rare orthodontic complication. The aim of this study was to report the clinical progression of discoloration during orthodontic treatment. Methods : Discolored teeth , detected during orthodontic treatment between January 2003 and December 2012 by a single dentist using similar techniques and appliances , were analyzed. Results : The total number of teeth that showed discoloration was 28. Progression of discoloration was evaluated in only 24 teeth that were observed without any treatment. During the observation period , the discoloration `` improved '' in 8 of the 24 teeth ( 33.3 % ) and was `` maintained '' in 16 ( 66.6 % ) . The electric pulp test performed at the time of initial detection of discoloration showed 14.3 % positivity , which improved to 21.4 % at the final follow-up. None of the initial and final follow-up radiographic findings showed any abnormalities. Conclusions : When teeth discoloration is detected during orthodontic treatment , observation as an initial management is recommended over immediate treatments . Objective : To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the diagnostic tools available for assessing maxillary transverse deficiencies. Methods : An electronic search of three databases was performed from their date of establishment to April 2015 , with manual searching of reference lists of relevant articles. Articles were considered for inclusion if they reported the accuracy or reliability of a diagnostic method or evaluation technique for maxillary transverse dimensions in mixed or permanent dentitions. Risk of bias was assessed in the included articles , using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool-2. Results : Nine articles were selected. The studies were heterogeneous , with moderate to low methodological quality , and all had a high risk of bias. Four suggested that the use of arch width prediction indices with dental cast measurements is unreliable for use in diagnosis. Frontal cephalograms derived from cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images were reportedly more reliable for assessing intermaxillary transverse discrepancies than posteroanterior cephalograms. Two studies proposed new three-dimensional transverse analyses with CBCT images that were reportedly reliable , but have not been validated for clinical sensitivity or specificity. No studies reported sensitivity , specificity , positive or negative predictive values or likelihood ratios , or ROC curves of the methods for the diagnosis of transverse deficiencies. Conclusions : Current evidence does not enable solid conclusions to be drawn , owing to a lack of reliable high quality diagnostic studies evaluating maxillary transverse deficiencies. CBCT images are reportedly more reliable for diagnosis , but further validation is required to confirm CBCT 's accuracy and diagnostic superiority . Objective : The aim of this study was to establish the normative data of dentofacial transverse dimensions according to the skeletal maturation stage in Korean adolescents with good occlusion , assess gender differences and determine correlations between transverse variables. Methods : A total of 577 Korean subjects between ages 7 to 19 years and exhibiting skeletal Class I occlusion were categorized by skeletal maturation index ( SMI ) of Fishman using hand-wrist radiographs. Dentofacial transverse dimensions were assessed using posteroanterior cephalograms. Independent two-samplet-tests were used to analyze differences between genders. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlation between transverse measurements. Results : Dentofacial transverse norms relevant to skeletal maturation stages were established. The average maxillomandibular width difference and ratio at growth completion was 22.16 mm and 77.01 % for males ; 23.70 mm and 74.06 % for females , respectively. Males had greater facial , maxillary and mandibular widths compared to females at every SMI stage. The maxillary and mandibular intermolar widths showed the strongest correlation for both sexes ( r = 0.826 for males , r = 0.725 for females ) . Conclusions : Dentofacial transverse norms of Korean adolescents were established according to developmental stage. All dentofacial widths were greater in males at growth completion. Maxillary and mandibular intermolar widths were strongly correlated. This study may serve as a guideline for the assessment of dentofacial transverse growth according to skeletal maturation stage in Korean adolescents with good occlusion . The popularity of clear overlay retainers ( CORs ) has increased recently because of their advantages such as better esthetics , cost effectiveness , easy fabrication , and good compliance. However , a deficiency in posterior occlusal settling is a reported limitation of CORs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the posterior occlusal contact changes in a new type of clear orthodontic retainer called Oral-treaper ( OTP ) , which consists of three layers and has stronger mechanical characteristics than do conventional retainers. Three patients who completed fixed orthodontic treatment received OTP as a removable retainer. Cast models were fabricated after the removal of fixed appliances ( T1 ) and after 4 to 11 months of using the retainers ( T2 ) . We evaluated all the cast models to compare the post-orthodontic settling pattern during the use of the OTPs. The depth of occlusal contacts was evaluated using color maps. The OTP did not prevent vertical settling in all patients but resulted in an improvement in posterior occlusal contact points . Objective : To investigate the treatment modalities ( Tx-Mods ) for patients with unilateral hemifacial microsomia ( UHFM ) according to Pruzansky-Kaban types and growth stages. Methods : The samples consisted of 82 Korean UHFM patients. Tx-Mods were defined as follows : Tx-Mod-1 , growth observation due to mild facial asymmetry ; Tx-Mod-2 , unilateral functional appliance ; Tx- Mod-3 , fixed orthodontic treatment ; Tx-Mod-4 , growth observation due to a definite need for surgical intervention ; Tx-Mod-5 , unilateral mandibular or bimaxillary distraction osteogenesis ( DO ) ; Tx-Mod-6 , maxillary fixation using LeFort I osteotomy and mandibular DO/sagittal split ramus osteotomy ; Tx- Mod-7 , orthognathic surgery ; and Tx-Mod-8 , costochondral grafting. The type and frequency of Tx-Mod , the number of patients who underwent surgical procedures , and the number of surgeries that each patient underwent , were investigated. Results : The degree of invasiveness and complexity of Tx-Mod increased , with an increase in treatment stage and Pruzansky-Kaban type ( initial < final ; [ I , IIa ] < [ IIb , III ] , allp < 0.001 ) . The percentage of patients who underwent surgical procedures increased up to 4.2 times , with an increase in the Pruzansky-Kaban type ( I , 24.1 % ; IIa , 47.1 % ; IIb , 84.4 % ; III , 100 % ; p < 0.001 ) . However , the mean number of surgical procedures that each patient underwent showed a tendency of increase according to the Pruzansky-Kaban types ( I , n = 1.1 ; IIa , n = 1.5 ; IIb , n = 1.6 ; III , n = 2.3 ; p > 0.05 ) . Conclusions : These findings might be used as basic guidelines for successful treatment planning and prognosis prediction in UHFM patients . Osteochondroma is a common benign tumor of bones , but it is rare in the mandibular condyle. With its outgrowth it manifests clinically as deviation of the mandible limitation of mouth opening , and facial asymmetry. After the tumor is diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and radiographic examination including cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) analysis , an appropriate surgery and treatment plan should be formulated. Herein , we present the case of a 44-year-old female patient who visited our dental hospital because her chin point had been deviating to the left side slowly but progressively over the last 3 years and she had difficulty masticating. Based on CBCT , she was diagnosed with skeletal Class III malocclusion accompanied by osteochondroma of the right mandibular condyle. Maxillary occlusal cant with the right side down was observed , but it was confirmed to be an extrusion of the molars associated with dental compensation. Therefore , after intrusion of the right molars with the use of temporary anchorage devices , sagittal split ramus osteotomy was used to remove the tumor and perform orthognathic surgery simultaneously. During 6 months after the surgery , continuous bone resorption and remodeling were observed in the condyle of the affected side , which led to a change in occlusion. During the postoperative orthodontic treatment , intrusive force and buccal torque were applied to the molars on the affected side , and a proper buccal overjet was created. After 18 months , CBCT revealed that the rate of bone absorption was continuously reduced , bone corticalization appeared , and good occlusion and a satisfying facial profile were achieved . Objective : To determine the effects of a local injection of leukocyte-platelet-rich plasma ( L-PRP ) on orthodontic tooth movement in rabbits. Methods : Twenty-three male New Zealand white rabbits were included in a split-mouth design. Tooth movement with a 100-g nickel-titanium closed-coil spring was performed on the maxillary first premolars. L-PRP was injected submucosally at the buccal and lingual areas of the first premolar in one random side of the maxilla and the other side served as the control and received normal saline. The amount of tooth movement was assessed on three-dimensional digital models on days 0 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , and 28. Histological findings and osteoclast numbers were examined on day 0 as the baseline and on days 7 , 14 , and 28. Results : The L-PRP group showed significantly greater cumulative tooth movement at all observed periods. However , a significantly higher rate of tooth movement was observed only on days 0-7 and 7-14. The osteoclast numbers were significantly increased in the L-PRP group on days 7 and 14. Conclusions : Local injection of L-PRP resulted in a transient increase in the rate of tooth movement and higher osteoclast numbers . This case report demonstrates two different uprighting mechanics separately applied to mesially tipped mandibular first and second molars. The biomechanical considerations for application of these mechanisms are also discussed. For repositioning of the first molar , which was severely tipped and deeply impacted , a novel cantilever mechanics was used. The molar tube was bonded in the buccolingual direction to facilitate insertion of a cantilever from the buccal side. By twisting the distal end of the cantilever , sufficient uprighting moment was generated. The mesial end of the cantilever was hooked over the miniscrew placed between the canine and first premolar , which could prevent exertion of an intrusive force to the anterior portion of the dentition as a side effect. For repositioning of the second molar , an uprighting mechanics using a compression force with two step bends incorporated into a nickel-titanium archwire was employed. This generated an uprighting moment as well as a distal force acting on the tipped second molar to regain the lost space for the first molar and bring it into its normal position. This epoch-making uprighting mechanics could also minimize the extrusion of the molar , thereby preventing occlusal interference by increasing interocclusal clearance between the inferiorly placed two step bends and the antagonist tooth. Consequently , the two step bends could help prevent occlusal interference. After 2 years and 11 months of active treatment , a desirable Class I occlusion was successfully achieved without permanent tooth extraction . Objective : Increased gingival elasticity has been implicated as the cause of relapse following orthodontic rotational tooth movement and approaches to reduce relapse are limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of sulforaphane ( SFN ) , an inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis , on gene expression in gingival fibroblasts and relapse after rotational tooth movement in beagle dogs. Methods : The lower lateral incisors of five beagle dogs were rotated. SFN or dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) were injected into the supra-alveolar gingiva of the experimental and control group , respectively , and the effect of SFN on relapse tendency was evaluated. Changes in mRNA expression of extracellular matrix components associated with gingival elasticity in beagles were investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Morphology and arrangement of collagen fibers were observed on Masson 's trichrome staining of buccal gingival tissues of experimental and control teeth. Results : SFN reduced the amount and percentage of relapse of orthodontic rotation. It also decreased the gene expression of lysyl oxidase and increased the gene expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) 1 andMMP12 , compared with DMSO control subjects. Histologically , collagen fiber bundles were arranged irregularly and were not well connected in the SFN-treated group , whereas the fibers extended in parallel and perpendicular directions toward the gingiva and alveolar bone in a more regular and well-ordered arrangement in the DMSO-treated group. Conclusions : Our findings demonstrated that SFN treatment may be a promising pharmacologic approach to prevent orthodontic rotational relapse caused by increased gingival elasticity of rotated teeth in beagle dogs . Objective : To systematically review previous studies and to assess , via a subgroup meta-analysis , the combined odds ratio ( OR ) of prognostic factors affecting the success of miniscrew implants ( MIs ) inserted into the buccal posterior region. Methods : Three electronic searches that were limited to articles on clinical human studies using MIs that were published in English prior to March 2015 were conducted. The outcome measure was the success of MIs. Patient factors included age , sex , and jaw of insertion ( maxilla vs. mandible ) , while the MI factors included length and diameter. A meta-analysis was performed on 17 individual studies. The quality of each study was assessed for non-randomized studies and quantified using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The meta-analysis outcome was a combined OR. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses based on the study design , study quality , and sample size of miniscrews implanted were performed. Results : Significantly higher success rates were revealed for MIs inserted in the maxilla , for patients 20 years of age , and for long MIs ( 8 mm ) and MIs with a large diameter ( > 1.4 mm ) . All subgroups acquired homogeneity , and the combined OR of the prospective studies ( OR , 3.67 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 2.10-6.44 ) was significantly higher in the maxilla than that in the retrospective studies ( OR , 2.10 ; 95 % CI , 1.60-2.74 ) . Conclusions : When a treatment plan is made , these risk factors , i.e. jaw of insertion , age , MI length , and MI diameter , should be taken into account , while sex is not critical to the success of MIs . Objective : This study evaluated the efficiency of anchorage provided by temporary anchorage devices ( TADs ) in maxillary bicuspid extraction cases during retraction of the anterior teeth using a fixed appliance. Methods : Patients aged 12 to 50 years with malocclusion for which bilateral first or second maxillary bicuspid extractions were indicated were included in the study and randomly allocated to the TAD or control groups. Retraction of the anterior teeth was achieved using skeletal anchorage in the TAD group and conventional dental anchorage in the control group. A computed tomography ( CT ) scan was performed after alignment of teeth , and a second CT scan was performed at the end of extraction space closure in both groups. A three-dimensional superimposition was performed to visualize and quantify the maxillary first molar movement during the retraction phase , which was the primary outcome , and the stability of TAD movement , which served as the secondary outcome. Results : Thirty-four patients ( 17 in each group ) underwent the final analysis. The two groups showed a significant difference in the movement of the first maxillary molars , with less significant anchorage loss in the TAD group than that in the control group. In addition , TAD movement showed only a slight mesial movement on the labial side. On the palatal side , the mesial TAD movement was greater. Conclusions : In comparison with conventional dental anchorage , TADs can be considered an efficient source of anchorage during retraction of maxillary anterior teeth. TADs remain stable when correctly placed in the bone during the anterior tooth retraction phase . Objective : To investigate and compare the slot sizes and parallelism of metal injection molding ( MIM ) and computerized numerical control ( CNC ) brackets. Methods : The following four MIM bracket series with 0.022-inch ( in ) slots were selected for investigation : Di MIM mini Twin ( Ortho Organizers ) , Mini Diamond Roth ( Ormco ) , Gemini MBT ( 3M Unitek ) , and Formula R Roth ( Tomy ) . The following four CNC bracket series with 0.022-in slots were selected for investigation : Econoline MBT ( Adenta ) , Legend mini MBT ( GC Orthodontics ) , Crown mini MBT ( Adenta ) , and Evolve MBT ( DB Orthodontics ) . The slot dimensions were measured using an optical microscope ( XTCam-D310M ; Mitutoyo ) with a resolution of 1 μm. The results were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and the Tukeypost-hoctest with a significance level of 0.05. Results : The results indicated that all the investigated slot sizes were oversized with respect to the manufacturers ' specifications ( 0.022 in ) . Among the eight bracket series , the Di MIM bracket ( MIM ) was the most oversized by 10.4 % , whereas the Evolve bracket ( CNC ) was the least oversized by 2.6 % . The slots in seven of the bracket series had divergent walls instead of parallel ones. The Evolve bracket alone had parallel slot walls. Conclusions : Regardless of the manufacturing method , all the slot sizes of the brackets investigated in this study were significantly oversized ; most of the slot walls were nonparallel , except for those of the Evolve bracket. This study could not establish that the CNC method was more accurate than the MIM method in manufacturing bracket slots . Objective : The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the pre- and postsurgical bone densities at alveolar and extra-alveolar sites following twojaw orthognathic surgery. Methods : The sample consisted of 10 patients ( mean age , 23.2 years ; range , 18.0-27.8 years ; 8 males , 2 females ) who underwent two-jaw orthognathic surgery. A three-dimensional imaging program ( Invivo 5 ) was used with multidetector computed tomography images taken preand postoperatively ( obtained 32.3 ± 6.0 days before surgery and 5.8 ± 2.6 days after surgery , respectively ) for the measurement of bone densities at the following sites : ( 1 ) alveolar bone in the maxilla and mandible , ( 2 ) extra-alveolar sites , such as the top of the head , menton ( Me ) , condyle , and the fourth cervical vertebrae ( C4 ) . Results : When pre- and postsurgical bone densities were compared , an overall tendency of decrease in bone density was noted. Statistically significant reductions were observed in the densities of cancellous bone at several areas of the maxillary alveolar bone ; cortical and cancellous bone in most areas of the mandibular alveolar bone ; cortical bone in Me ; and cancellous bone in C4. There was no statistically significant difference in bone density in relation to the depth of the alveolar bone. In a comparison of the bone densities between groups with and without genioplasty , there was almost no statistically significant difference. Conclusions : Accelerated tooth movement following orthognathic surgery may be confirmed with reduced bone density. In addition , this study could offer insights into bone metabolism changes following orthognathic surgery , providing direction for further investigations in this field . Objective : Biplanar imaging systems allow for simultaneous acquisition of lateral and frontal cephalograms. The purpose of this study was to compare measurements recorded on three-dimensional ( 3D ) cephalograms constructed from two-dimensional conventional radiographs and biplanar radiographs generated using a new biplanar imaging system with those recorded on cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) -generated cephalograms in order to evaluate the accuracy of the 3D cephalograms generated using the biplanar imaging system. Methods : Three sets of lateral and frontal radiographs of 15 human dry skulls with prominent facial asymmetry were obtained using conventional radiography , the biplanar imaging system , and CBCT. To minimize errors in the construction of 3D cephalograms , fiducial markers were attached to anatomical landmarks prior to the acquisition of radiographs. Using the 3D Ceph program , 3D cephalograms were constructed from the images obtained using the biplanar imaging system ( 3D cephbiplanar ) , conventional radiography ( 3D cephconv ) , and CBCT ( 3D cephcbct ) . A total of 34 measurements were obtained compared among the three image sets using pairedt-tests and Bland-Altman plotting. Results : There were no statistically significant differences between the 3D cephbiplanarand 3D cephcbctmeasurements. In addition , with the exception of one measurement , there were no significant differences between the 3D cephcbctand 3D cephconvmeasurements. However , the values obtained from 3D cephconvshowed larger deviations than those obtained from 3D cephbiplanar. Conclusions : The results of this study suggest that the new biplanar imaging system enables the construction of accurate 3D cephalograms and could be a useful alternative to conventional radiography . Objective : Preservation of the periodontal ligament ( PDL ) is vital to the success of tooth autotransplantation ( TAT ) . Increased PDL volumes and facilitated tooth extraction have been observed upon orthodontic preloading. However , it is unclear whether any changes occur in the expressions of bone biomolecules in the increased PDL volumes. This study aimed to determine the expressions of runt-related transcription factor 2 ( RUNX2 ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( RANKL ) , and osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) in PDL upon preloading. Methods : Seventy-two premolars from 18 patients were randomly assigned to experimental groups that received a leveling force for 1 , 2 , or 4 weeks or to a control unloaded group. Following extraction , PDL volumes from 32 premolars of eight patients ( 21.0 ± 3.8 years ) were evaluated using toluidine blue staining. The expressions of the biomolecules in the PDL from 40 premolars of ten patients ( 21.4 ± 4.0 years ) were analyzed via immunoblotting. Results : The median percentage of stained PDL was significantly higher at 2 and 4 weeks after preloading than in the unloaded condition ( p < 0.05 ) . The median RUNX2 and ALP expression levels were significantly higher at 2 and 4 weeks after preloading than in the unloaded condition ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas the median RANKL/OPG ratios were significantly higher at 1 and 4 weeks after preloading ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Orthodontic preloading for 4 weeks enhances PDL volumes as well as the expressions of RUNX2 , ALP and the RANKL/OPG ratio in the PDL , suggesting this loading period is suitable for successful TAT . Objective : The aim of this study was to compare recycled and unused orthodontic miniscrews to determine the feasibility of reuse. The comparisons included both miniscrews with machined surfaces ( MS ) , and those with etched surfaces ( ES ) . Methods : Retrieved MS and ES were further divided into three subgroups according to the assigned recycling procedure : group A , air-water spray ; group B , mechanical cleaning ; and group C , mechanical and chemical cleaning. Unused screws were used as controls. Scanning electron microscopy , energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry , insertion time and maximum insertion torque measurements in artificial bone , and biological responses in the form of periotest values ( PTV ) , bone-implant contact ratio ( BIC ) , and bone volume ratio ( BV ) were assessed. Results : Morphological changes after recycling mainly occurred at the screw tip , and the cortical bone penetration success rate of recycled screws was lower than that of unused screws. Retrieved ES needed more thorough cleaning than retrieved MS to produce a surface composition similar to that of unused screws. There were no significant differences in PTV or BIC between recycled and unused screws , while the BV of the former was significantly lower than that of the latter ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : These results indicate that reuse of recycled orthodontic miniscrews may not be feasible from the biomechanical aspect . Objective : The objective of this study was to analyze the patterns of tooth movements when distalization of mandibular molars using a mini-plate took place. A finite element analysis was applied to analyze patterns of tooth movements. Methods : The model of the mandible and teeth were used to build a finite element analysis model , and a mini-plate was inserted in the mandibular ramus. Two different orthodontic forces were established for displacement of mandibular molars. Orthodontic forces were applied at the level of the bracket and at the level of the cemento-enamel junction in the mandibular canine respectively. Results : orthodontic forces at the level of the cemento-enamel junction resulted in a greater biomechanical bodily movement in distalization of the mandibular molars compared to when the orthodontic forces were applied at the level of the bracket. Applying orthodontic forces to the cemento-enamel junction also resulted in unwanted greater extrusive movements in distalization of the mandibular molars compared to the bracket level. Conclusions : With considering the mode of orthodontic teeth movement , applying different vertical orthodontic forces for distalization of mandibular molars can lead to more effective distalization of teeth . Objective : The aim of this study was to analyze the surface composition , roughness , and relative friction of metal clips from various ceramic self-ligating brackets. Methods : Six kinds of brackets were examined. The control group ( mC ) consisted of interactive metal self-ligating brackets while the experimental group ( CC , EC , MA , QK , and WA ) consisted of interactive ceramic self-ligating brackets. Atomic force microscopy-lateral force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to analyze the surface of each bracket clip. Results : All the clips in the experimental groups were coated with rhodium except for the QK clip. The results showed that the QK clip had the lowest average roughness on the outer surface , followed by the MA , EC , WA , and CC clips. However , the CC clip had the lowest average roughness on the inner surface , followed by the QK , WA , MA , and EC clips. The QK clip also had the lowest relative friction on the outer surface , followed by the MA , EC , CC , and WA clips. Likewise , the CC clip had the lowest relative friction on the inner surface , followed by the QK , WA , MA , and EC clips. Conclusions : The surface roughness and relative friction of the rhodium-coated clips were generally higher than those of the uncoated clips . Objective : To evaluate the construction reproducibility of a composite tooth model ( CTM ) composed of an intraoral-scanned crown and a cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) -scanned root. Methods : The study assessed 240 teeth ( 30 central incisors , 30 canines , 30 second premolars , and 30 first molars in the maxillary and mandibular arches ) from 15 young adult patients whose pre-treatment intraoral scan and CBCT were available. Examiner-Reference ( 3 years ' experience in CTM construction ) and Examiners-A and Examiner-B ( no experience ) constructed the individual CTMs independently by performing the following steps : image acquisition and processing into a three-dimensional model , integration of intraoral-scanned crowns and CBCT-scanned teeth , and replacement of the CBCT-scanned crown with the intraoral-scanned crown. The tooth axis angle in terms of mesiodistal angulation and buccolingual inclination of the CTMs constructed by the three examiners were measured. To assess the construction reproducibility of CTMs , intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) assessments were performed. Results : The ICC values of mesiodistal angulation and buccolingual inclination among the 3 examiners showed excellent agreement ( 0.950-0.992 and 0.965-0.993 ; 0.976-0.994 and 0.973-0.995 in the maxillary and mandibular arches , respectively ) . Conclusions : The CTM showed excellent construction reproducibility in mesiodistal angulation and buccolingual inclination regardless of the construction skill and experience levels of the examiners . Objective : This questionnaire study aimed to estimate the overall frequencies of positive perception towards orthodontic treatment among adults categorized according to age , sex , and area of living , and to identify barriers or negative perceptions preventing them from receiving orthodontic treatment. Methods : The participants included 598 adults aged over 20 years ( 230 men and 368 women ) who visited the Dental Hospital of Seoul St. Mary 's Hospital. The participants ' opinions regarding their consideration of receiving orthodontic treatment were recorded using a specially designed questionnaire. Results : The overall rate of positive perception towards orthodontic treatment was 48.5 % . Compared to adults in their 20s ( 63.2 % ) , those in their 40s and 50s had a lower percentage of interest in orthodontic treatment ( 46.2 % and 45.1 % , respectively ; p < 0.05 ) . Overall , women ( 52.2 % ) had a higher rate of interest than did men ( 42.6 % ; p < 0.05 ) . The area of living had no effect on the percentage of interest. The order of priority of chief complaints differed according to age : protrusion for those in the 20s and 30s , and spacing for those in the 40s to 60s. Overall , the main reason for not seeking treatment was the treatment fee. Respondents aged over 40 considered themselves `` too old '' for orthodontic treatment. Conclusions : The middle-aged had a relatively high percentage of interest ( above 45 % ) in orthodontic treatment. However , demographic characteristics were not significantly associated with the positive interest. These results highlight the need for educating the middle-aged about the limitations and possibilities of orthodontic treatment to increase its acceptance . Objective : The purpose of this study was to determine whether the results of fractal analysis can be used as criteria for midpalatal suture maturation evaluation. Methods : The study included 131 subjects aged over 18 years of age ( range 18.1-53.4 years ) who underwent cone-beam computed tomography. Skeletonized images of the midpalatal suture were obtained via image processing software and used to calculate fractal dimensions. Correlations between maturation stage and fractal dimensions were calculated using Spearman 's correlation coefficient. Optimal fractal dimension cut-off values were determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Results : The distribution of maturation stages of the midpalatal suture according to the cervical vertebrae maturation index was highly variable , and there was a strong negative correlation between maturation stage and fractal dimension ( -0.623 , p < 0.001 ) . Fractal dimension was a statistically significant indicator of dichotomous results with regard to maturation stage ( area under curve = 0.794 , p < 0.001 ) . A test in which fractal dimension was used to predict the resulting variable that splits maturation stages into ABC and D or E yielded an optimal fractal dimension cut-off value of 1.0235. Conclusions : There was a strong negative correlation between fractal dimension and midpalatal suture maturation. Fractal analysis is an objective quantitative method , and therefore we suggest that it may be useful for the evaluation of midpalatal suture maturation . Objective : The aim of this study was to compare the buccolingual inclination of maxillary and mandibular molars in adults with different vertical facial types. Methods : Cone-beam computed tomography images of 135 adult patients ( age , 20-45 years ) with skeletal Class I maxillomandibular relationships were assigned to normodivergent ( n = 46 ) , hypodivergent ( n = 49 ) , and hyperdivergent groups ( n = 40 ) according to linear and angular sella-nasion/gonion-menton measurements. The normodivergent group consisted of 24 females and 22 males , hypodivergent group of 26 females and 23 males , and hyperdivergent group of 24 females and 16 males. Buccolingual inclination of the maxillary and mandibular first and second molars was measured relative to the occlusal plane. One-way analysis of variance was used for intergroup comparison. Gender differences were evaluated using independentt-tests. Results : Buccolingual molar inclinations did not differ significantly between females and males ( p > 0.05 ) . There were no statistically significant differences among the buccolingual inclinations of the first and second maxillary and mandibular molars of the groups ( p > 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Buccolingual inclinations of maxillary and mandibular molars are similar in normodivergent , hyperdivergent , and hypodivergent adults with Class I sagittal relationships . Odontogenic keratocysts ( OKCs ) are one of the most aggressive cysts in the oral and maxillofacial area because of their high recurrence rate and infiltrative behavior. In growing patients with OKCs , a radical treatment approach might cause numerous complications , including the disturbance of jaw growth and loss of the involved tooth. This case report describes successful comprehensive orthodontic treatment combined with marsupialization of the cyst in a young girl who exhibited an OKC with impacted teeth. The 10-year-old girl presented with an OKC extending from the mandibular symphysis through the left mandibular body , with ectopic impaction of the mandibular left canine and first premolar , as well as congenitally missing bilateral mandibular second premolars. Interestingly , spontaneous improvement of the positions of the ectopic impacted teeth , along with a reduction in the size of the cyst , occurred during marsupialization. The sequential use of removable and fixed appliances enabled orthodontic traction of the impacted teeth. The treatment outcome was stable at 2.5 years after the end of the treatment. We speculate that comprehensive orthodontic treatment combined with marsupialization can be an effective treatment strategy for patients with OKCs , especially when they are encountered in young , growing patients with impacted teeth . Objective : The objective of this two-arm parallel trial was to compare the type of tooth movement duringen masseretraction of the maxillary anterior teeth using labial versus lingual biocreative therapy. Methods : Twenty-eight subjects were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to either the labial or lingual group.En masseanterior retraction was performed using labial biocreative therapy in group A and lingual biocreative therapy in group B. Cone beam computed tomography scans were taken before and after retraction and the primary outcome was the type of tooth movement during anterior retraction. Data were analyzed using pairedt-tests for comparisons within each group and independent-samplet-test for comparison of the mean treatment changes between the two groups. Results : Significant differences were found between the two groups in relation to the type of tooth movement ( labiolingual inclination of the central incisor ; mean difference , 5.85 ± 1.85° ) . The canine showed significant distal tipping in the lingual group ( mean difference , 6.98 ± 1.25° ) . The canine was significantly more intruded in the lingual group ( mean difference , 1.67 ± 0.49 mm ) . Good anchorage control and significant soft tissue changes occurred in both groups. No serious adverse effects were detected. Conclusions : With a 10-mm retraction hook , the labial biocreative technique with the reverse curve overlay provided anterior retraction with good torque control , while in the lingual group , anterior retraction occurred with controlled tipping movement with significant distal tipping and intrusion of the canine ( trial registration : The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov [ NCT03239275 ] ) . Objective : The aim was to assess the intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities of temporomandibular joint linear measurements and condylar shape classifications performed with cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) . Methods : CBCT images of 30 patients were measured at two different time points by two orthodontists using the Dolphin 3D program ( n = 60 ) . Anterior , posterior , and superior joint space measurements and sagittal joint morphology classification in the sagittal view and medial and lateral joint space and mediolateral width measurements and coronal joint morphology classification in the coronal view were recorded. Intraclass-interclass correlation coefficients ( ICC ) and kappa statistics were used to assess intraobserver and interobserver reliability for the measurements and morphology classifications , respectively. Results : The ICC values were good for measurements of the posterior joint space by observer I and for measurements of the posterior , medial , and lateral joint spaces by observer II , while the other intraobserver measurements were excellent. Only the mediolateral width measurements showed excellent interobserver ICC values , while the other measurements showed good interobserver ICC values. Intraobserver agreement for the sagittal morphology classifications was moderate ( κ = 0.479 ) and almost perfect ( κ = 0.858 ) for observers I and II , respectively , while the corresponding agreement for the coronal morphology classifications was substantial for both observers. The interobserver agreement values for sagittal and coronal morphology classifications were slight ( κ = 0.181 ) and fair ( κ = 0.265 ) , respectively. Conclusions : Linear temporomandibular joint measurements were reproducible and reliable in both intraobserver and interobserver evaluations. However , interobserver agreement for assessments of condylar shape was low . Objective : The purpose of this study was to predict the optimal bending angles of a running loop for bodily protraction of the mandibular first molars and to clarify the mechanics of molar tipping and rotation. Methods : A three-dimensional finite element model was developed for predicting tooth movement , and a mechanical model based on the beam theory was constructed for clarifying force systems. Results : When a running loop without bends was used , the molar tipped mesially by 9.6° and rotated counterclockwise by 5.4°. These angles were almost similar to those predicted by the beam theory. When the amount of tip-back and toe-in angles were 11.5° and 9.9° , respectively , bodily movement of the molar was achieved. When the bend angles were increased to 14.2° and 18.7° , the molar tipped distally by 4.9° and rotated clockwise by 1.5°. Conclusions : Bodily movement of a mandibular first molar was achieved during protraction by controlling the tip-back and toe-in angles with the use of a running loop. The beam theory was effective for understanding the mechanics of molar tipping and rotation , as well as for predicting the optimal bending angles . Objective : To investigate the three-dimensional ( 3D ) surgical accuracy between virtually planned and actual surgical movements ( SM ) of the maxilla in twojaw orthognathic surgery. Methods : The sample consisted of 15 skeletal Class III patients who underwent two-jaw orthognathic surgery performed by a single surgeon using a virtual surgical simulation ( VSS ) software. The 3D cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images were obtained before ( T0 ) and after surgery ( T1 ) . After merging the dental cast image onto the T0 CBCT image , VSS was performed. SM were classified into midline correction ( anterior and posterior ) , advancement , setback , anterior elongation , and impaction ( total and posterior ) . The landmarks were the midpoint between the central incisors , the mesiobuccal cusp tip ( MBCT ) of both first molars , and the midpoint of the two MBCTs. The amount and direction of SM by VSS and actual surgery were measured using 3D coordinates of the landmarks. Discrepancies less than 1 mm between VSS and T1 landmarks indicated a precise outcome. The surgical achievement percentage ( SAP , [ amount of movement in actual surgery/ amount of movement in VSS ] _ 100 ) ( % ) and precision percentage ( PP , [ number of patients with precise outcome/number of total patients ] _ 100 ) ( % ) were compared among SM types using Fisher 's exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results : Overall mean discrepancy between VSS and actual surgery , SAP , and PP were 0.13 mm , 89.9 % , and 68.3 % , respectively. There was no significant difference in the SAP and PP values among the seven SM types ( allp > 0.05 ) . Conclusions : VSS could be considered as an effective tool for increasing surgical accuracy . Objective : Forced eruption has been proposed for the reconstruction of deficient bone and soft tissue. The aim of this study was to examine the changes in the alveolar ridge width and the vertical levels of the interproximal bone and papilla following forced eruption. Methods : Patients whose hopeless maxillary anterior teeth were expected to undergo severe bone resorption and soft tissue recession upon extraction were recruited. In addition , patients whose maxillary anterior teeth required forced eruption for restoration due to tooth fracture or dental caries were included. Before and after forced eruption , the interproximal bone height was measured by radiographic analysis , and changes in the alveolar ridge width and the interproximal papilla height were measured with an acrylic stent. Results : This prospective study demonstrated that the levels of the interproximal alveolar bone and papilla were significantly increased by 1.36 mm and 1.09 mm , respectively , in the vertical direction. However , the alveolar ridge width was significantly reduced by an average of 0.67 mm in the buccolingual direction. The changes in the level of the interproximal alveolar bone and papilla were positively correlated. Conclusions : Although the levels of the interproximal bone and papilla were significantly increased , the alveolar ridge width was significantly decreased following forced eruption. There was a modest positive and significant correlation between the changes in the height of the interproximal alveolar bone and the papilla. Based on our findings , modification of vertical forced eruption should be considered when augmentation of the alveolar ridge width is required . Objective : The aim of this study was to compare the initial stability as insertion and removal torque and the clinical applicability of novel orthodontic zirconia micro-implants made using a powder injection molding ( PIM ) technique with those parameters in conventional titanium micro-implants. Methods : Sixty zirconia and 60 titanium micro-implants of similar design ( diameter , 1.6 mm ; length , 8.0 mm ) were inserted perpendicularly in solid polyurethane foam with varying densities of 20 pounds per cubic foot ( pcf ) , 30 pcf , and 40 pcf. Primary stability was measured as maximum insertion torque ( MIT ) and maximum removal torque ( MRT ) . To investigate clinical applicability , compressive and tensile forces were recorded at 0.01 , 0.02 , and 0.03 mm displacement of the implants at angles of 0° , 10° , 20° , 30° , and 40°. The biocompatibility of zirconia micro-implants was assessed via an experimental animal study. Results : There were no statistically significant differences between zirconia micro-implants and titanium alloy implants with regard to MIT , MRT , or the amount of movement in the angulated lateral displacement test. As angulation increased , the mean compressive and tensile forces required to displace both types of micro-implants increased substantially at all distances. The average bone-to-implant contact ratio of prototype zirconia micro-implants was 56.88 ± 6.72 % . Conclusions : Zirconia micro-implants showed initial stability and clinical applicability for diverse orthodontic treatments comparable to that of titanium micro-implants under compressive and tensile forces . Objective : This study was performed to validate the autonomous maximal smile ( AMS ) as a new reference for evaluating dental and gingival exposure. Methods : Digital video clips of 100 volunteers showing posed smiles and AMS at different verbal directives were recorded for evaluation a total of three times at 1-week intervals. Lip-teeth relationship width ( LTRW ) and buccal corridor width ( BCW ) were measured. LTRW represented the vertical distance between the inferior border of the upper vermilion and the edge of the maxillary central incisors. Intraclass correlation coefficients ( ICCs ) for reproducibility , and the m-value ( minimum number of repeated measurements required for an ICC level over 0.75 ) , were calculated. Results : LTRW and BCW of the AMS were 1.41 and 2.04 mm , respectively , greater than those of the posed smile ( p < 0.05 ) , indicating significantly larger dental and gingival exposure in the AMS. The reproducibility of the AMS ( 0.74 to 0.77 ) was excellent , and higher than that of the posed smile ( 0.62 to 0.65 ) , which had fair-to-good reproducibility. Moreover , the m-value of the AMS ( 0.88 to 1.05 ) was lower than that of the posed smile ( 1.59 to 1.85 ) . Conclusions : Compared to the posed smile , the AMS shows significantly larger LTRW and BCW , with significantly higher reproducibility. The AMS might serve as an adjunctive reference , in addition to the posed smile , in orthodontic and other dentomaxillofacial treatments . Objective : This study aimed to evaluate the differences in cephalometric characteristics and skeletal maturation in girls with central precocious puberty ( CPP ) via lateral and hand-wrist radiographs. We also aimed to identify the indicators that are most effective for determining skeletal maturity in these patients. Methods : The study included 70 Korean girls ( mean age , 8.5 ± 0.5 years ) diagnosed with CPP at the Department of Pediatrics , and 48 normal healthy age-matched girls who visited the Department of Orthodontics and had no history of hormone treatment or growth problems. Skeletal maturation was evaluated using lateral cephalometric and hand-wrist radiographs using cervical vertebrae maturation indicators ( CVMI ) and skeletal maturity indicators ( SMI ) . Results : The mean mandibular plane angle was smaller in the CPP group than in the control group ( 35.8° ± 4.9° vs. 39.0° ± 6.5° ) , resulting in greater posterior facial height ( p= 0.003 ) . SMI was significantly greater in the CPP group ( 3.5 ± 1.4 vs. 2.0 ± 1.0 ) than in the control group ( p= 0.001 ) and was significantly associated with CPP ( r= 0.492 ; p= 0.001 ) , whereas CVMI was not. Conclusions : In comparison with the control group , the CPP group exhibited a smaller mandibular plane angle , greater posterior facial height , and greater skeletal maturation. SMI may be more suitable than CVMI for determining skeletal maturation in CPP. Hand-wrist radiography is recommended in addition to lateral cephalogram for predicting growth in girls with CPP . Objective : The objective of this study is to investigate the eruption pattern and root resorption of the bovine anterior dentition in relation to growth-related parameters based on dental maturity. Methods : A cross-sectional study was conducted on 110 bovine anterior mandibles by using standard radiography , cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) , and actual measurements. We determined the relationships between the stages of dental maturity by using a modification of Demirjian 's method and various growth-related parameters , such as the activity of the root-resorbing tissue and mobility of the deciduous teeth. The correlation of growth-related parameters with interdental spacing and distal unusual root resorption ( DRR ) of the deciduous fourth incisor was assessed. The cause of mesial unusual root resorption ( MRR ) of the deciduous fourth incisor was determined on the basis of the arrangement of the permanent third incisor. Results : An independentt-test and chi-square test indicated significant differences in growth-related parameters associated with dental arch length discrepancy and factors related to the shedding of deciduous teeth between the low and high dental maturity groups. The samples with interdental spacing and DRR showed a larger sum of mesiodistal permanent crown widths and higher dental maturity than did the respective controls. Samples with MRR tended to show a lingually rotated distal tip of the adjacent tooth crown. Conclusions : Dental maturity has relevance to the interdental spaces and unusual root resorption of mixed dentition. The position of the adjacent tooth crown on CBCT may be correlated with the occurrence of unusual root resorption of the incisor . Objective : Precise identification of landmarks on posteroanterior ( PA ) cephalograms is necessary when evaluating lateral problems such as facial asymmetry. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the use of lateral ( LA ) cephalograms can reduce errors in landmark identification on PA cephalograms. Methods : Five examiners identified 16 landmarks ( Cg , N , ANS , GT , Me , RO , Lo , FM , Z , Or , Zyg , Cd , NC , Ms , M , and Ag ) on 32 PA cephalograms with and without LA cephalograms at the same time. The positions of the landmarks were recorded and saved in the horizontal and vertical direction. The mean errors and standard deviation of landmarks location according to the use of LA cephalograms were compared for each landmark. Results : Relatively small errors were found for ANS , Me , Ms , and Ag , while relatively large errors were found for N , GT , Z , Or , and Cd. No significant difference was found between the horizontal and vertical errors for Z and Or , while large vertical errors were found for N , GT , and Cd. The value of identification error was lower when the landmarks were identified using LA cephalograms. Statistically significant error reductions were found at N and Cd with LA cephalograms , especially in the vertical direction. Conclusions : The use of LA cephalograms during identification of landmarks on PA cephalograms could help reduce identification errors . This study was performed to describe the longitudinal management of recurrent temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) ankylosis from infancy to adulthood in perspective of surgical and orthodontic treatment. A 2-year-old girl was referred with chief complaints of restricted mouth opening and micrognathia due to bilateral TMJ ankylosis. For stage I treatment during early childhood ( 6 years old ) , high condylectomy and interpositional arthroplasty were performed. However , TMJ ankylosis recurred and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) developed. For stage II treatment during early adolescence ( 12 years old ) , gap arthroplasty , coronoidectomy , bilateral mandibular distraction osteogenesis , and orthodontic treatment with extraction of the four first premolars were performed. However , TMJ ankylosis recurred. Because the OSA symptoms reappeared , she began to use a continuous positive airway pressure device. For stage III treatment after completion of growth ( 20 years old ) , low condylectomy , coronoidectomy , reconstruction of the bilateral TMJs with artificial prostheses along with counterclockwise rotational advancement of the mandible , genioglossus advancement , and orthodontic treatment were performed. After stage III treatment , the amount of mouth opening exhibited a significant increase. Mandibular advancement and ramus lengthening resulted in significant improvement in the facial profile , Class I relationships , and normal overbite/overjet. The OSA symptoms were also relieved. These outcomes were stable at the one-year follow-up visit. Since the treatment modalities for TMJ ankylosis differ according to the duration of ankylosis , patient age , and degree of deformity , the treatment flowchart suggested in this report could be used as an effective guideline for determining the appropriate timing and methods for the treatment of TMJ ankylosis . Objective : The purpose of this study was to classify Korean young adults into 3 groups on the basis of upper incisor exposure rates ( UIERs ) and to compare the skeletal , dental , and soft tissue variables. Methods : Samples were obtained from 127 students at the College of Dentistry , Wonkwang University in South Korea. Facial photographs of frontal posed smiles and lateral cephalograms of the subjects were taken. The subjects were divided into 3 groups on the basis of UIERs and 20 measurements were compared among the 3 groups. The correlations between the variables were determined. Results : Male and female subjects showed significant differences in the group distribution. Male subjects showed higher frequencies of low smiles , and female subjects showed higher frequencies of high smiles. The vertical height of the anterior alveolar process of the maxilla directly correlated with the UIER. However , the UIER showed no significant correlation with the vertical height of the anterior basal bone or the inclination of the upper incisor axis. In female subjects , the upper central incisor clinical crown length showed an inverse correlation with the UIER. However , this variable showed no significant correlation with the UIER in male subjects. Conclusions : The UIER was directly correlated with the levator muscle activity of the upper lip and inversely correlated with the upper lip thickness , yet there was no correlation between the UIER and upper lip length at rest . Objective : The aim of this study was to analyze three-dimensional ( 3D ) changes in maxillary dentition in Class II malocclusion treatment using arch wire with continuous tip-back bends or compensating curve , together with intermaxillary elastics by superimposing 3D virtual models. Methods : The subjects were 20 patients ( 2 men and 18 women ; mean age 20 years 7 months ± 3 years 9 months ) with Class II malocclusion treated using 0.016 _ 0.022-inch multiloop edgewise arch wire with continuous tip-back bends or titanium molybdenum alloy ideal arch wire with compensating curve , together with intermaxillary elastics. Linear and angular measurements were performed to investigate maxillary teeth displacement by superimposing pre- and post-treatment 3D virtual models using Rapidform 2006 and analyzing the results using pairedt-tests. Results : There were posterior displacement of maxillary teeth ( p < 0.01 ) with distal crown tipping of canine , second premolar and first molar ( p < 0.05 ) , expansion of maxillary arch ( p < 0.05 ) with buccoversion of second premolar and first molar ( p < 0.01 ) , and distal-in rotation of first molar ( p < 0.01 ) . Reduced angular difference between anterior and posterior occlusal planes ( p < 0.001 ) , with extrusion of anterior teeth ( p < 0.05 ) and intrusion of second premolar and first molar ( p < 0.001 ) was observed. Conclusions : Class II treatment using an arch wire with continuous tip-back bends or a compensating curve , together with intermaxillary elastics , could retract and expand maxillary dentition , and reduce occlusal curvature. These results will help clinicians in understanding the mechanism of this Class II treatment . Objective : This study compared three prominent midsagittal planes ( MSPs ) to identify the MSP that best approximates the true symmetrical MSP. Methods : Forty-three patients ( mean age , 23.0 ± 8.20 years ) were grouped as follows : group 1 consisted of 10 patients with skeletal Class I and a menton ( Me ) deviation of < 2 mm ; group 2 , 11 patients with skeletal Class III and a Me deviation < 2 mm ; group 3 , nine patients with skeletal Class III and a Me deviation of 2 to less than 4 mm ; and group 4 , 13 patients with skeletal Class III and an Me deviation 4 mm. The candidate MSPs were established by three-dimensional ( 3D ) cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) reorientation methods ( RMs ) : ( 1 ) the MSP perpendicular to the Frankfort horizontal ( FH ) plane while passing through the crista galli and basion ; ( 2 ) the MSP including the nasion , incisive foramen , and basion ; ( 3 ) the MSP including the nasion , anterior nasal spine , and posterior nasal spine. The mean absolute distances ( MADs ) to the MSPs were calculated from the coordinates of 1,548 points on 129 CBCT images. The differences in the values of the 3D coordinates among RMs were compared. Results : The MADs of the three RMs showed significant differences ( p < 0.05 ) . Most of the differences in values of the coordinates were not significant among RMs. Conclusions : Although the differences in distance among the three MSPs were minor , the MSP perpendicular to the FH plane while passing through the crista galli and basion best approximated the true symmetrical MSP . Objective : The purpose of this study was to compare the precision of three-dimensional ( 3D ) images acquired using iTero® ( Align Technology Inc. , San Jose , CA , USA ) and Trios® ( 3Shape Dental Systems , Copenhagen , Denmark ) digital intraoral scanners , and to evaluate the effects of the severity of tooth irregularities and scanning sequence on precision. Methods : Dental arch models were fabricated with differing degrees of tooth irregularity and divided into 2 groups based on scanning sequence. To assess their precision , images were superimposed and an optimized superimposition algorithm was employed to measure any 3D deviation. The t-test , paired t-test , and one-way ANOVA were performed ( p < 0.05 ) for statistical analysis. Results : The iTero® and Trios® systems showed no statistically significant difference in precision among models with differing degrees of tooth irregularity. However , there were statistically significant differences in the precision of the 2 scanners when the starting points of scanning were different. The iTero® scanner ( mean deviation , 29.84 ± 12.08 µm ) proved to be less precise than the Trios® scanner ( 22.17 ± 4.47 µm ) . Conclusions : The precision of 3D images differed according to the degree of tooth irregularity , scanning sequence , and scanner type. However , from a clinical standpoint , both scanners were highly accurate regardless of the degree of tooth irregularity . Objective : The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in masticatory efficiency among patients with different Angle 's classes of malocclusion and to assess the correlation between masticatory efficiency and the occlusal contact area. Methods : The mixing ability index ( MAI ) was calculated for measuring masticatory efficiency of 61 adult patients according to Angle 's classifications of malocclusion. The study included 25 , 15 , and 21 patients with Angle 's Class I , II , and III malocclusions , respectively. Silicone interocclusal recording material was used to measure the occlusal contact area. Results : Both the MAI and occlusal contact area showed the highest average values in the Class I malocclusion group , followed by the Class II and Class III malocclusion groups. No significant difference was observed in the MAI values between the Class I and Class II malocclusion groups ( p > 0.05 ) , whereas a significant difference was observed between the Class I and Class III malocclusion groups ( p < 0.01 ) and between the Class II and Class III malocclusion groups ( p < 0.05 ) . A weak positive correlation was also observed between the MAI and occlusal contact area ( p < 0.01 , r2= 0.13 ) . Conclusions : The results of this study indicated that masticatory efficiency was the highest in patients with Angle 's Class I malocclusion , followed by those with Angle 's Class II and Angle 's Class III malocclusions. Moreover , a weak positive correlation was observed between masticatory efficiency and the occlusal contact area . Introduction : Identifying menton ( Me ) on posteroanterior cephalograms and three-dimensional ( 3D ) cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images is difficult , because the midpoint of the symphyseal area is not identifiable after the mandibular symphysis fuses at an early age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the identification of the genial tubercle ( GT ) in patients with mandibular asymmetry and to compare it with that of the traditional landmark , Me. Methods : The samples comprised 20 CBCT images of adults with mandibular asymmetry. Two examiners performed the identifications and measurements. Me and GT were marked , and the anteroposterior , vertical , and transverse distances to the three reference planes were measured on 3D-reconstructed CBCT images. The intra- and inter-examiner reliability of landmark identification of Me and GT were assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) and Bland-Altman plots. Results : The Me and GT landmarks showed excellent reliability ( ICC 0.993 ) three-dimensionally. In the transverse evaluation , the ICC values of the GT ( range , 0.997-0.999 ) tended to be slightly higher than those of Me ( range , 0.993-0.996 ) . In the Bland-Altman plots for the two separate assessments , Me showed a maximum error of 1.76 mm in the transverse direction , whereas the GT showed a maximum error of 0.96 mm in the 95 % limit. Conclusions : Our results suggest that both Me and GT are clinically reliable and equally useful landmarks for the evaluation of mandibular asymmetry on CBCT images . Objective : To evaluate the effectiveness of three different caries-preventing agents on artificial caries in aStreptococcus mutans-based caries model. Methods : Sixty-five caries-free human molar enamel blocks were treated with a demineralization solution and a remineralization solution. The specimens were assigned to the following groups according to the caries-protective product applied : group A , chlorhexidine varnish ; group B , fluoride-releasing chemically cured sealant ; group C , fluoride-releasing lightcured sealant ; group D , positive control ( specimens that were subjected to de- and remineralization cycles without treatment with any caries-protective agents ) ; and group E , negative control ( specimens that were not subjected to de- and remineralization cycles ) . Samples in groups A-D were stored in demineralization solution withS. mutansand thereafter in artificial saliva. This procedure was performed for 30 days. Average fluorescence loss ( F ) and surface size of the lesions were measured using quantitative light-induced fluorescence at baseline and on the 7th , 14th , and 30th days. Results : After 30 days , group A demonstrated a significant increase in F and the surface size of the lesions , no significant difference in comparison with the positive control group , and a significant difference in comparison with the negative control group. Group B showed no significant changes in both parameters at any of the measurement points. While group C showed increased F after 14 days , no significant fluorescence change was observed after 30 days. Conclusions : Both fluoride-releasing sealants ( chemically or light-cured ) show anti-cariogenic effects , but the use of chlorhexidine varnish for the purpose of caries protection needs to be reconsidered . Objective : The efficacy of mandibular advancement devices ( MADs ) in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) ranges between 42 % and 65 % . However , it is still unclear which predictive factors can be used to select suitable patients for MAD treatment. This study aimed to systematically review the literature on the predictive value of cephalometric analysis for MAD treatment outcomes in adult OSA patients. Methods : The MEDLINE , Google Scholar , Scopus , and Cochrane Library databases were searched through December 2014. Reference lists from the retrieved publications were also examined. English language studies published in international peer-reviewed journals concerning the predictive value of cephalometric analysis for MAD treatment outcome were considered for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed eligibility , extracted data , and ascertained the quality of the studies. Results : Fifteen eligible studies were identified. Most of the skeletal , dental , and soft tissue cephalometric measurements examined were widely recognized as not prognostic for MAD treatment outcome ; however , controversial and limited data were found on the predictive role of certain cephalometric measurements including cranial base angle , mandibular plane angle , hyoid to mandibular plane distance , posterior nasal spine to soft-palate tip distance , anterior nasal spine to epiglottis base distance , and tongue/oral cross sectional area ratio thus justifying additional studies on these parameters. Conclusions : Currently available evidence is inadequate for identification of cephalometric parameters capable of reliably discriminating between poor and good responders to MAD treatment. To guide further research , methodological weaknesses of the currently available studies were highlighted and possible reasons for their discordant results were analyzed . Objective : The aim of this systematic multiscale analysis was to evaluate the effects of thermoforming on the physical and mechanical properties of thermoplastic materials used to fabricate transparent orthodontic aligners ( TOAs ) . Methods : Specimens were fabricated using four types of thermoplastic materials with different thicknesses under a thermal vacuum. Transparency , water absorption and solubility , surface hardness , and the results of three-point bending and tensile tests were evaluated before and after thermoforming. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Student'st-test. Results : After thermoforming , the transparency of Duran and Essix A+ decreased , while the water absorption ability of all materials ; the water solubility of Duran , Essix A+ , and Essix ACE ; and the surface hardness of Duran and Essix A+ increased. The flexure modulus for the 0.5-mm-thick Duran , Essix A+ , and eCligner specimens increased , whereas that for the 0.75-/1.0-mm-thick Duran and eClginer specimens decreased. In addition , the elastic modulus increased for the 0.5-mm-thick Essix A+ specimens and decreased for the 0.75-mm-thick Duran and Essix ACE and the 1.0-mm-thick Essix ACE specimens. Conclusions : Our findings suggest that the physical and mechanical properties of thermoplastic materials used for the fabrication of TOAs should be evaluated after thermoforming in order to characterize their properties for clinical application . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate treatment effects after distalization of the mandibular dentition using ramal plates through lateral cephalograms. Methods : Pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalograms and dental casts of 22 adult patients ( 11 males and 11 females ; mean age , 23.9 ± 5.52 years ) who received ramal plates for mandibular molar distalization were analyzed. The treatment effects and amount of distalization of the mandibular molars were calculated and tested for statistical significance. The significance level was set at p < 0.001. Results : The mandibular first molar distalization at the crown and root were 2.10 mm ( p < 0.001 ) and 0.81 mm ( p = 0.011 ) , respectively. In the evaluation of skeletal variables , there was a significant increase in the Wits appraisal ( p < 0.001 ) . In the evaluation of the soft tissue , there was no significant effect on upper lip position , but the lower lips showed a significant retraction of 2.2 mm ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : The mandibular molars showed a significant amount of distalization accompanied by limited extrusion and mesiobuccal rotation of the crowns. A ramal plate may be a viable device for mandibular total arch distalization in Class III patients who are reluctant to undergo orthognathic surgery . Objective : This study investigated the relationship between orthodontic treatment and temporomandibular disorders ( TMD ) in South Korean population. Methods : This study obtained data from the 2012 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The final sample size was 5,567 participants who were 19 years of age. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between orthodontic treatment and TMD. Results : Participants who underwent orthodontic treatment showed higher educational level , lower body mass index , reduced chewing difficulty , and reduced speaking difficulty. The adjusted odds ratios ( ORs ) and their 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) for orthodontic treatment and TMD were 1.614 ( 1.189-2.190 ) , 1.573 ( 1.162-2.129 ) and 1.612 ( 1.182-2.196 ) after adjusting for age , sex and psychosocial factors. Adjusted ORs and their 95 % CIs for orthodontic treatment and clicking were 1.778 ( 1.289-2.454 ) , 1.742 ( 1.265-2.400 ) and 1.770 ( 1.280-2.449 ) after adjusting for confounding factors. However , temporomandibular joint pain and functional impairment was not associated with orthodontic treatment. Conclusions : Temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction was not associated with orthodontic treatment . Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the facial skeletal patterns and the shape of the mandibular symphysis in adults with malocclusion by using a structural equation model ( SEM ) . Methods : Ninety adults who had malocclusion and had records of facial skeletal measurements performed using cone-beam computed tomography were selected for this study. The skeletal measurements were classified into three groups ( vertical , anteroposterior , and transverse ) . Cross-sectional images of the mandibular symphysis were analyzed using generalized Procrustes and principal component ( PC ) analyses. A SEM was constructed after the factors were extracted via factor analysis. Results : Two factors were extracted from the transverse , vertical , and anteroposterior skeletal measurements. Latent variables were extracted for each factor. PC1 , PC2 , and PC3 were selected to analyze the variations of the mandibular symphyseal shape. The SEM was constructed using the skeletal variables , PCs , and latent variables. The SEM showed that the vertical latent variable exerted the most influence on the mandibular symphyseal shape. Conclusions : The relationship between the skeletal pattern and the mandibular symphysis was analyzed using a SEM , which showed that the vertical facial skeletal pattern had the highest effect on the shape of the mandibular symphysis . Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate the stability of bimaxillary surgery involving bilateral intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy performed with or without presurgical miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion ( MARPE ) in adult patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion. Methods : A total of 40 adult patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion were retrospectively divided into two groups ( n = 20 each ) according to the use of MARPE for the correction of transverse maxillomandibular discrepancy during presurgical orthodontic treatment. Serial lateral cephalograms and dental casts were analyzed until 6 months after surgery. Results : Before presurgical orthodontic treatment , there was no significant differences in terms of sex and age between groups. However , the difference of approximately 3.1 mm in the maxillomandibular intermolar width was statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) . Two days after surgery , the mandible had moved backward and upward without any significant intergroup difference. Six months after surgery , the maxillary intercanine ( 2.7 ± 2.1 mm ) , interpremolar ( 3.6 ± 2.4 mm ) , and intermolar ( 2.0 ± 1.3 mm ) arch widths were significantly increased ( p < 0.001 ) relative to the values before presurgical orthodontic treatment in the MARPE group ; these widths were maintained or decreased in the control group. However , there was no significant difference in surgical changes and the postsurgical stability between the two groups. No significant correlations existed between the amount of maxillary expansion and postsurgical mandibular movement. Conclusions : MARPE is useful for stable and nonsurgical expansion of the maxilla in adult patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion who are scheduled for bimaxillary surgery . Objective : The purpose of this study was to compare the skeletal , dental , and soft-tissue treatment effects of nonextraction therapy using the modified C-palatal plate ( MCPP ) to those of premolar extraction ( PE ) treatment in adult patients with Class II malocclusion. Methods : Pretreatment and posttreatment lateral cephalographs of 40 adult patients with Class II malocclusion were retrospectively analyzed. The MCPP group comprised 20 patients treated with total arch distalization of the maxillary arch while the PE group comprised 20 patients treated with four PE. Fifty-eight linear and angular measurements were analyzed to assess the changes before and after treatment. Descriptive statistics , pairedt-test , and multivariate analysis of variance were performed to evaluate the treatment effects within and between the two groups. Results : The MCPP group presented 3.4 mm of retraction , 1.0 mm of extrusion , and 7.3° lingual inclination of the maxillary central incisor. In comparison , the PE group displayed greater amount of maxillary central incisor retraction and retroclination , mandibular incisor retraction , and upper lip retraction ( 5.3 mm , 14.8° , 5.1 mm , and 2.0 mm , respectively ; p < 0.001 for all ) . In addition , the MCPP group showed 4.0 mm of distalization and 1.3 mm of intrusion with 2.9° distal tipping of the maxillary first molars. Conclusions : These findings suggest the MCPP is an effective distalization appliance in the maxillary arch. The amount of incisor retraction , however , was significantly higher in the PE group. Therefore , four PE may be recommended when greater improvement of incisor position and soft-tissue profile is required . Objective : The aim of this study is to compare the adaptation of a straight wire between brackets positioned at the mid-lingual surface and those placed gingivally by using a three-dimensional simulation software. Methods : This cross-sectional study was performed using OrthoAid , an in-house software. The subjects were 36 adolescents with normal Class I occlusion. For each dental cast , two bracket positioning approaches , namely the middle and gingival , were examined. In the middle group , the reference points were placed on the mid-lingual surface of each tooth , while in the gingival group , the reference points were positioned lingually on the anterior teeth. A 4th degree polynomial was adopted , and the in-plane and off-plane root mean squares ( RMSs ) of the distances between the reference points and the fitted polynomial curve were calculated using the software. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired-samplest-test ( α = 0.05 ) . Results : The mean in-plane RMS of the polynomial curve to the bracket distance in the gingival group was significantly lower than that in the middle group ( p < 0.001 ) . The off-plane RMS was higher in the gingivally positioned brackets in the maxilla than in the middle group ( p < 0.001 ) . However , the off-plane RMS in mandible was not statistically significantly different between the two groups ( p= 0.274 ) . Conclusions : The results demonstrated that the gingival placement of lingual brackets on the anterior teeth could decrease the distance between a tooth and the straight wire . Objective : Given the considerable disagreement between the Peer Assessment Rating ( PAR ) index and the American Board of Orthodontics Cast-Radiograph Evaluation , we aimed to develop a novel assessment system-the Improvement and Completion of Outcome ( ICO ) index-to evaluate the outcome of orthodontic treatment. Methods : Sixteen criteria from 4 major categories were established to represent the pretreatment malocclusion status , as well as the degree of improvement and level of completion of outcome during/after treatment : dental relationship ( arch length discrepancy , irregularity , U1-SN , and IMPA ) ; anteroposterior relationship ( overjet , right and left molar position , ANB ) ; vertical relationship ( anterior overbite , anterior open-bite , lateral open-bite , SN-MP ) ; and transverse relationship ( dental midline discrepancy , chin point deviation , posterior cross-bite , occlusal plane cant ) . The score for each criterion was defined from 0 or -1 ( worst ) to 5 ( ideal value or normal occlusion ) in gradations of 1. The sum of the scores in each category indicates the area and extent of the problems. Improvement and completion percentages were estimated based on the pre- and post-treatment total scores and the maximum total score. If the completion percentage exceeded 80 % , treatment outcome was considered successful. Results : Two cases , Class I malocclusion and skeletal Class III malocclusion , are presented to represent the assessment procedure using the ICO index. The difference in the level of improvement and completion of treatment outcome can be clearly explained by using 2 percentage values. Conclusions : Thus , the ICO index enables the evaluation of the quality of orthodontic treatment objectively and consecutively throughout the entire treatment process . The committee of admitted doctors developed a questionnaire regarding medical dispute and distributed it to 1,600 members of Korean Academy of Orthodontics. The questionnaire consisted of three categories and 56 items covering basic information about the doctors and patients who had experienced medical disputes , the cause and workaround of medical accidents , and methods for taking precautions. The present survey showed a similar proportion of responders who had experienced a medical accident compared to the study in 1997. The primary reason for medical disputes was dissatisfaction with appearance. Many doctors felt that they would likely experience a medical dispute at some point. Most disputes were settled by doctors themselves , usually for an amount of less than 5 million Korean won. For some doctors , medical accidents lead to ongoing psychological problems. Responders felt that continuing education for medical dispute is very necessary. These results reveal a need for the association of orthodontists to lead advancements in education and countermeasures for preventing and managing medical accidents and disputes . Objective : Microbial aggregation around dental implants can lead to loss/loosening of the implants. This study was aimed at surface treating titanium microimplants with silver nanoparticles ( AgNPs ) to achieve antibacterial properties. Methods : AgNP-modified titanium microimplants ( Ti-nAg ) were prepared using two methods. The first method involved coating the microimplants with regular AgNPs ( Ti-AgNP ) and the second involved coating them with a AgNP-coated biopolymer ( Ti-BP-AgNP ) . The topologies , microstructures , and chemical compositions of the surfaces of the Ti-nAg were characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) equipped with energy-dispersive spectrometer ( EDS ) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) . Disk diffusion tests usingStreptococcus mutans , Streptococcus sanguinis , andAggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitanswere performed to test the antibacterial activity of the Ti-nAg microimplants. Results : SEM revealed that only a meager amount of AgNPs was sparsely deposited on the Ti-AgNP surface with the first method , while a layer of AgNP-coated biopolymer extended along the Ti-BP-AgNP surface in the second method. The diameters of the coated nanoparticles were in the range of 10 to 30 nm. EDS revealed 1.05 atomic % of Ag on the surface of the Ti-AgNP and an astounding 21.2 atomic % on the surface of the Ti-BP-AgNP. XPS confirmed the metallic state of silver on the Ti-BP-AgNP surface. After 24 hours of incubation , clear zones of inhibition were seen around the Ti-BP-AgNP microimplants in all three test bacterial culture plates , whereas no antibacterial effect was observed with the Ti-AgNP microimplants. Conclusions : Titanium microimplants modified with Ti-BP-AgNP exhibit excellent antibacterial properties , making them a promising implantable biomaterial . The incorporation of technological advances in the field of clinical orthodontics to increase treatment efficiency has led to the development of customized appliances ( Insignia® ) , archwires ( Suresmile® ) , and the production of devices to enhance tooth movement ( Acceledent® ) . This review presents a comprehensive study of the literature concerning these products , and analyzes the available evidence of their efficiency. To date , one pilot study has evaluated the efficiency of the Insignia® system , three retrospective studies have assessed the efficiency of the Suresmile® system , and a few Acceledent® reports have described its effect on treatment time. Critical appraisal of the reviewed papers revealed that the efficiency of the Insignia® system can not be confirmed based on the available evidence , while the use of Suresmile® can reduce overall treatment time in simple cases. The acceleration of tooth movement by Acceledent® devices has not yet been confirmed . Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate factors influencing the success rate of orthodontic microimplants ( OMIs ) using panoramic radiographs ( PRs ) . Methods : We examined 160 OMIs inserted bilaterally in the maxillary buccal alveolar bone between the second premolars and first molars of 80 patients ( 51 women , 29 men ; mean age , 18.0 ± 6.1 years ) undergoing treatment for malocclusion. The angulation and position of OMIs , as well as other parameters , were measured on PRs. The correlation between each measurement and the OMI success rate was then evaluated. Results : The overall success rate was 85.0 % ( 136/160 ) . Age was found to be a significant predictor of implant success ( p < 0.05 ) , while sex , side of placement , extraction , and position of the OMI tip were not significant predictors ( p > 0.05 ) . The highest success rate was observed for OMIs with tips positioned on the interradicular midline ( IRML ; central position ) . Univariate analyses revealed that the OMI success rate significantly increased with an increase in the OMI length and placement height of OMI ( p= 0.001 ) . However , in simultaneous analyses , only length remained significant ( p= 0.027 ) . Root proximity , distance between the OMI tip and IRML , interradicular distance , alveolar crest width , distance between the OMI head and IRML , and placement angle were not factors for success. Correlations between the placement angle and all other measurements except root proximity were statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Our findings suggest that OMIs positioned more apically with a lesser angulation , as observed on PRs , exhibit high success rates . Objective : The objective of the study was to evaluate the practicality and the validity of different surface treatments of self-drilling orthodontic mini-implants ( OMIs ) by comparing bone cutting capacity and osseointegration. Methods : Self-drilling OMIs were surface-treated in three ways : Acid etched ( Etched ) , resorbable blasting media ( RBM ) , partially resorbabla balsting media ( Hybrid ) . We compared the bone cutting capacity by measuring insertion depths into artificial bone ( polyurethane foam ) . To compare osseointegration , OMIs were placed in the tibia of 25 rabbits and the removal torque value was measured at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 weeks after placement. The specimens were analyzed by optical microscopy , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ( EDS ) . Results : The bone cutting capacity of the etched and hybrid group was lower than the machined ( control ) group , and was most inhibited in the RBM group ( p < 0.05 ) . At 4 weeks , the removal torque in the machined group was significantly decreased ( p < 0.05 ) , but was increased in the etched group ( p < 0.05 ) . In the hybrid group , the removal torque significantly increased at 2 weeks , and was the highest among all measured values at 8 weeks ( p < 0.05 ) . The infiltration of bone-like tissue surface was evaluated by SEM , and calcium and phosphorus were detected via EDS only in the hybrid group. Conclusions : Partial RBM surface treatment ( hybrid type in this study ) produced the most stable self-drilling OMIs , without a corresponding reduction in bone cutting capacity . Objective : The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of commercially available fluoride-containing oral rinses on the corrosion behavior of titanium alloys , which are the main components of orthodontic miniscrews. Methods : Four commercially available oral rinses ( solution A , pH 4.46/260 ppm fluoride ; solution B , pH 4.41/178 ppm fluoride ; solution C , pH 6.30/117 ppm fluoride ; and solution D , pH 4.17/3.92 ppm fluoride ) were tested on titanium alloy ( Ti-6Al-4V ) circular plates , and saline was used as the control. The open-circuit potential and potentiodynamic polarization of these materials were measured. Thereafter , all samples were evaluated under a field-emission scanning electron microscope. Results : Among the tested oral rinses , except solution D , the more the fluoride content was , the greater was the corrosion potential downtrend ; the corrosion resistance of the titanium alloy sample was also lowered significantly ( p < 0.05 ) . Field-emission scanning electron microscopic analysis of the surface morphology of the titanium alloy samples revealed that all samples had some defects , crevices , or pitting after exposure to the oral rinses than before treatment. In particular , the samples in solution A showed the most changes. Conclusions : Commercially available oral rinses having a high fluoride concentration and a low pH may reduce the corrosion resistance of titanium alloys used in dental appliances such as orthodontic titanium miniscrews and brackets . Hemifacial microsomia ( HFM ) patients may experience emotional withdrawal during their growth period due to their abnormal facial appearance. Distraction osteogenesis at an early age to improve their appearance can encourage these patients. Some abnormalities of the affected side can be overcome by distraction osteogenesis at an early age. However , differences in the growth rate between the affected and unaffected sides during the rest of the growth period are inevitable due to the characteristics of HFM. Therefore , re-evaluation should be performed after completion of growth in order to achieve stable occlusion through either orthognathic surgery or camouflage orthodontic treatment. An eight-year-old patient visited the clinic exhibiting features of HFM with slight mandibular involvement. He received phase I treatment with distraction osteogenesis and a functional appliance. Distraction osteogenesis was performed at the right ramus , which resulted in an open bite at the right posterior dentition. After distraction osteogenesis , a functional appliance and partial fixed appliance were used to achieve extrusion of the affected posterior dentition and settlement of the occlusion adjustment on the unaffected posterior dentition. The patient visited the clinic regularly for follow-up assessments , and at the age of 20 years , he showed facial asymmetry of the mandible , which had deviated to the right side. He received orthodontic treatment to improve the occlusion of his posterior dentition after the growth period. Without orthognathic surgery , stable occlusion and a satisfactory facial appearance were obtained through camouflage orthodontic treatment . Objective : This study aimed to evaluate the immediate effects of mandibular posterior displacement on the pharyngeal airway space ( PAS ) by using cephalometric evaluations and to investigate how the surrounding structures are schematically involved. Methods : In this retrospective study , 38 subjects with functional Class III malocclusion and two lateral cephalograms were selected. The first lateral cephalogram was taken with the mandible in the habitual occlusal position , and the second in anterior edge-to-edge bite. Pairedt-test was used to analyze changes in the PAS , hyoid bone , tongue , and soft palate , followed by mandibular posterior displacement. Pearson 's correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between the amount of mandibular posterior displacement and other variables. Results : A statistically significant decrease was observed in the PAS following mandibular posterior displacement. Along with mandibular posterior displacement , the tongue decreased in length ( p < 0.001 ) and increased in height ( p < 0.05 ) , while the soft palate increased in length , decreased in thickness , and was posteriorly displaced ( p < 0.001 ) . The hyoid bone was also posteriorly displaced ( p < 0.05 ) . There was no correlation between the amount of mandibular posterior displacement and the measured variables. Conclusions : The PAS showed a statistically significant decrease following mandibular posterior displacement , which was a consequence of retraction of the surrounding structures. However , there were individual variances between the amount of mandibular posterior displacement and the measured variables . Objective : This study was performed to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of a newly designed method to achieve mandibular dental model superimposition , using voxel-based cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) registration. Methods : Fourteen dry cadaveric mandibles and six teeth extracted from patients with severe periodontitis were used to establish 14 orthodontic tooth-movement models. The protocol consisted of two steps : in the first step , voxel-based CBCT mandible superimposition was performed ; the reference comprised the external portion of the symphysis , extending to the first molar. The laser-scanned dental model image was then integrated with the CBCT image to achieve mandibular dental model superimposition. The entire process required approximately 10 minutes. Six landmarks were assigned to the teeth to measure tooth displacement , using tooth displacement on the superimposed laser-scanned mandibles as the reference standard. Accuracy was evaluated by comparing differences in tooth displacement based on the method and the reference standard. Two observers performed superimposition to evaluate reliability. Results : For three-dimensional tooth displacements , the differences between the method and the reference standard were not significant in the molar , premolar , or incisor groups ( p > 0.05 ) . The intraclass correlation coefficients for the inter- and intra-observer reliabilities of all measurements were > 0.92. Conclusions : Our method of mandibular dental model superimposition based on voxel registration is accurate , reliable , and can be performed within a reasonable period of timein vitro , demonstrating a potential for use in orthodontic patients . Objective : To evaluate the effectiveness of the Frog appliance in three dimensions by using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images. Methods : Forty patients ( 21 boys and 19 girls ) , averaged 11.7 years old , with an Angle Class II division 1 malocclusion were included in our study. They had either late mixed dentition or early permanent dentition , and the maxillary second molars had not yet erupted. All patients underwent CBCT before and after the treatment for measuring changes in the maxillary first molars , second premolars , central incisors , and profile. Paired-samplest-test was used to compare the mean difference in each variable before treatment and after the first phase of treatment. Results : The maxillary first molars were effectively distalized by 4.25 mm ( p < 0.001 ) and 3.53 mm ( p < 0.05 ) in the dental crown and root apex , respectively. The tipping increased by 2.25° , but the difference was not significant. Moreover the teeth moved buccally by 0.84 mm ( p < 0.05 ) and 2.87 mm ( p < 0.01 ) in the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps , respectively , whereas no significant changes occurred in the root apex. Regarding the anchorage parts , the angle of the maxillary central incisor 's long axis to the sella-nasion plane increased by 2.76° ( p < 0.05 ) and the distance from the upper lip to the esthetic plane decreased by 0.52 mm ( p= 0.01 ) . Conclusions : The Frog appliance effectively distalized the maxillary molars with an acceptable degree of tipping , distobuccal rotation , and buccal crown torque , with only slight anchorage loss. Furthermore , CBCT image demonstrated that it is a simple and reliable method for three-dimensional analysis . Objective : Different methods have been utilized to prevent enamel demineralization and other complications during orthodontic treatment. However , none of these methods can offer long-lasting and effective prevention of orthodontic complications or interventions after complications occur. Considering the photocatalytic effect of TiO2 on organic compounds , we hoped to synthesize a novel bracket with a TiO2 thin film to develop a photocatalytic antimicrobial effect. Methods : The sol-gel dip coating method was used to prepare TiO2 thin films on ceramic bracket surfaces. Twenty groups of samples were composed according to the experimental parameters. Crystalline structure and surface morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy , respectively ; film thickness was examined with a surface ellipsometer. The photocatalytic properties under ultraviolet ( UV ) light irradiation were analyzed by evaluating the degradation ratio of methylene blue ( MB ) at a certain time. Antibacterial activities of selected thin films were also tested against Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. Results : Films with 5 coating layers annealed at 700 showed the greatest photocatalytic activity in terms of MB decomposition under UV light irradiation. TiO2 thin films with 5 coating layers annealed at 700 exhibited the greatest antimicrobial activity under UV-A light irradiation. Conclusions : These results provide promising guidance in prevention of demineralization by increasing antimicrobial activities of film coated brackets . Objective : The aims of this study were to measure and compare the facial dimensions of the Miss Korea pageant contestants and a selected group of women from the general population by using three-dimensional ( 3D ) image analysis , as well as to compare various facial ratios to the golden ratio within each group. Methods : Three-dimensional images of 52 Miss Korea pageant contestants ( MK group ) and 41 young female adults selected from the general population ( GP group ) were acquired. Fifty-four variables and ratios were measured and calculated. Intergroup comparisons were performed using multivariate analysis of variance. Results : Compared to the GP group , the MK group showed greater total facial height and eye width , lesser lower-facial height , and lesser facial , lower-facial , and nasal widths. Moreover , compared to the GP group , the MK group had more protruded noses with greater nasolabial angle , greater vertical curvature of the foreheads , lesser horizontal curvature of the cheek , and lesser lower-lip-and-chin volume. Conclusions : The MK group had longer faces but smaller lower lips and chins than did the GP group. The golden ratio was not matching the current facial esthetic standards. These data might be beneficial for treatment planning of patients undergoing orthognathic and plastic surgeries . Objective : The purpose of this study was to compare the static ( SFF ) and kinetic frictional forces ( KFF ) of a computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing lingual bracket ( CAD/CAM-LB ) with those of conventional LB ( Con-LB ) and Con-LB with narrow bracket width ( Con-LB-NBW ) under 3 tooth displacement conditions. Methods : The samples were divided into 9 groups according to combinations of 3 LB types ( CAD/CAM-LB [ Incognito ] , Con-LB [ 7th Generation , 7G ] , and Con-LB-NBW [ STb ] ) with 3 displacement conditions ( no displacement [ control ] , maxillary right lateral incisor with 1-mm palatal displacement [ MXLI-PD ] , and maxillary right canine with 1-mm gingival displacement [ MXC-GD ] ; n = 6/group ) . While drawing a 0.016-inch copper or super-elastic nickel-titanium archwire with 0.5 mm/min for 5 minutes in a chamber maintained at 36.5 , SFF and KFF were measured. The Kruskal-Wallis method with Bonferroni correction was performed. Results : The Incognito group demonstrated the highest SFF , followed by the 7G and STb groups ( [ STb-control , STb-MXLI-PD , Stb-MXC-GD ] < [ 7G-MXC-GD , 7G-MXLI-PD , 7G-control ] < [ Incognito-MXLI-PD , Incognito-control , Incognito-MXC-GD ] ; p < 0.001 ) . However , there were no significant differences in SFF among the 3 displacement conditions within each bracket group. Within each displacement condition , the Incognito group demonstrated the highest KFF , followed by the 7G and STb groups ( [ STb-control , STb-MXLI-PD ] < Stb-MXC-GD < 7G-MXLI-PD < [ 7G-control , 7G-MXC-GD ] < [ 7G-MXC-GD , Incognito-MXLI-PD , Incognito-control ] < [ Incognito-control , Incognito-MXC-GD ] ; p < 0.001 ) . MXC-GD exhibited higher KFFs than MXLI-PD in the same bracket group. Conclusions : The slot design and ligation method of the CAD/CAM-LB system should be modified to reduce SFF and KFF during the leveling/alignment stage . Objective : Sliding mechanics using orthodontic miniscrews is widely used to stabilize the anchorage during extraction space closure. However , previous studies have reported that both posterior segment displacement and anterior segment displacement are possible , depending on the mechanical properties of the archwire. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of archwire stiffness and friction change on the displacement pattern of the maxillary posterior segment during anterior segment retraction with orthodontic miniscrews in sliding mechanics. Methods : A three-dimensional finite element model was constructed. The retraction point was set at the archwire level between the lateral incisor and canine , and the orthodontic miniscrew was located at a height of 8 mm from the archwire between the second premolar and first molar. Archwire stiffness was simulated with rectangular stainless steel wires and a rigid body was used as a control. Various friction levels were set for the surface contact model. Displacement patterns for the posterior and anterior segments were compared between the conditions. Results : Both the anterior and posterior segments exhibited backward rotation , regardless of archwire stiffness or friction. Among the conditions tested in this study , the least undesirable rotation was found with low archwire stiffness and low friction. Conclusions : Posterior segment displacement may be unavoidable but reducing the stiffness and friction of the main archwire may minimize unwanted rotations during extraction space closure . Objective : This study was performed to investigate the rate of tooth movement and histological characteristics of extraction sockets those were subjected to corticotomy. Methods : A split-mouth randomized controlled trial experiment was designed. Thirty-two adult , male Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups : healing extraction socket ( H ) and recent extraction socket ( R ) ; these groups were randomly classified into 4 subgroups ( 0/7/21/60 days ) . The first maxillary molar was extracted on 1 side and 2 months were allowed for complete bone healing ; then , the corresponding molar was extracted on the other side and surgical intervention was performed at the mid-alveolar point of the first maxillary molar. Ten grams of continuous force was applied. The outcomes measured were rate of tooth movement , percentage of periodontal space and histological evaluation. The rate of tooth movement was calculated as the measured distance divided by the duration of molar movement. Histomorphometric evaluations were performed on the second and third maxillary molars. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare differences between the two groups. Results : There were no significant differences in the rates of tooth movement between H and R groups at any of the 4 time points. The histological appearance and percentage of periodontal space between the R and H groups also demonstrated no significant differences. Conclusions : The rates of orthodontic tooth movement into recent and healed socket sites did not differ between the groups. Histological analysis of tooth movement revealed regional acceleration during every time period . Objective : This study aimed to evaluate the effects of force loading on root damage caused by contact with temporary anchorage devices ( TADs ) during orthodontic treatment and to examine the repair process 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks after TAD contact by micro-computed tomography ( CT ) . Methods : We enrolled 42 volunteers who required bilateral upper first premolar extractions. The experimental study design was as follows. For both first premolars , cantilever springs were placed , and then TADs were immediately inserted between the premolars of all volunteers. According to the removal order of the appliances , the participants were divided into the TAD group ( Group T : n = 21 , only TAD removal ) and the spring group ( Group S : n = 21 , only spring removal ) . A split-mouth design was adopted in both groups as follows. For each volunteer , the left premolars were extracted 4 , 8 , or 12 weeks after TAD-root contact. The right premolars were extracted immediately after contact in both groups ( Groups T-C and S-C ) and used as positive controls. Resorption volumes and numbers of craters were determined by micro-CT. Results : The numbers of resorption craters were higher in Group T than in Group S at 8 and 12 weeks ( p < 0.01 ) . Crater volumes were higher in Group T than in Group S at 4 and 12 weeks ( p < 0.01 , both ) . Conclusions : Root injury was not completely repaired 12 weeks after root-TAD contact , even when the TADs were removed in cases of continuous force application . Objective : The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term stability of rapid palatal expansion ( RPE ) followed by full fixed edgewise appliances. Methods : This study included 67 patients treated using Haas-type RPE and non-extraction edgewise appliance therapy at a single orthodontic practice. Serial dental casts were obtained at three different time points : pretreatment ( T1 ) , after expansion and fixed appliance therapy ( T2 ) , and at long-term recall ( T3 ) . The mean duration of the T1-T2and T2-T3periods was 4.8 ± 3.5 years and 11.0 ± 5.4 years , respectively. The dental casts were digitized , and the computed measurements were compared with untreated reference data. Results : The majority of treatment-related increases in the maxillary and mandibular arch measurements were statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) and greater than expected for the untreated controls. Although many measurements decreased postretention ( T2-T3 ) , the net gains persisted for all of the measurements evaluated. Conclusions : The use of RPE therapy followed by full fixed edgewise appliances is an effective method for increasing maxillary and mandibular arch width dimensions in growing patients . Objective : This study was performed to investigate an appropriate degree of prestretch for orthodontic synthetic elastomeric chains focusing on time-dependent viscoelastic properties. Methods : Orthodontic synthetic elastomeric chains of two brands were prestretched to 50 , 100 , 150 , and 200 % of the original length in one and three cycles , and the hysteresis areas of the obtained stress-strain curves were determined. Acrylic plates were employed to maintain constant strain during the experiment. A total of 180 samples were classified into nine groups according to brand , and their stresses and permanent deformations were measured immediately after prestretch ( 0 hour ) , after 1 hour and 24 hours , and after 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8 weeks. The relationship between stress relaxation and permanent deformation was investigated for various degrees of prestretch , and the estimated stress resulting from tooth movement was calculated. Results : The degree of prestretch and the stress relaxation ratio exhibited a strong negative correlation , whereas no correlation was found between the degree of prestretch and the average normalized permanent strain. The maximal estimated stress was observed when prestretch was performed in three cycles to 200 % of the original length. Conclusions : Although prestretch benefited residual stress , it did not exhibit negative effects such as permanent deformation. The maximal estimated stress was observed at the maximal prestretch , but the difference between prestretch and control groups decreased with time. In general , higher residual stresses were observed for product B than for product A , but this difference was not clinically significant . Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the nasal soft tissues , including movements of landmarks , changes in linear distances , and volumetric changes , using three-dimensional ( 3D ) stereophotogrammetry after microimplant-assisted rapid palatal expansion ( MARPE ) in adult patients. Methods : Facial data were scanned using a white light scanner before and after MARPE in 30 patients. In total , 7 mm of expansion was achieved over a 4-week expansion period. We determined 10 soft tissue landmarks using reverse engineering software and measured 3D vector changes at those points. In addition , we calculated the distances between points to determine changes in the width of the nasal soft tissues. The volumetric change in the nose was also measured. Results : All landmarks except pronasale and subnasale showed statistically significant movement on the x-axis. Pronasale , subnasale , alar right , and alar left showed significant movement on the y-axis , while all landmarks except subnasale showed significant movement on the z-axis. The alar base width , alar width , and alar curvature width increased by 1.214 , 0.932 , and 0.987 mm , respectively. The average volumetric change was 993.33 mm3 , and the amount of increase relative to the average initial volume was 2.96 % . Conclusions : The majority of soft tissue landmarks around the nasal region show significant positional changes after MARPE in adults. The nose tends to widen and move forward and downward. The post-treatment nasal volume may also exhibit a significant increase relative to the initial volume. Clinicians should thoroughly explain the anticipated changes to patients before MARPE initiation . Objective : To assess shear bond strength and failure mode ( Adhesive Remnant Index , ARI ) of orthodontic brackets bonded to polymethylmethacrylate ( PMMA ) blocks for computer-aided design/manufacture ( CAD/CAM ) fabrication of temporary restorations , following substrate chemical or mechanical treatment. Methods : Two types of PMMA blocks were tested : CAD-Temp® ( VITA ) and Telio® CAD ( Ivoclar-Vivadent ) . The substrate was roughened with 320-grit sandpaper , simulating a fine-grit diamond bur. Two universal adhesives , Scotchbond Universal Adhesive ( SU ) and Assure Plus ( AP ) , and a conventional adhesive , Transbond XT Primer ( XTP ; control ) , were used in combination with Transbond XT Paste to bond the brackets. Six experimental groups were formed : ( 1 ) CADTemp®/SU ; ( 2 ) CAD-Temp®/AP ; ( 3 ) CAD-Temp®/XTP ; ( 4 ) Telio® CAD/SU ; ( 5 ) Telio® CAD/AP ; ( 6 ) Telio® CAD/XTP. Shear bond strength and ARI were assessed. On 1 extra block for each PMMA-based material surfaces were roughened with 180-grit sandpaper , simulating a normal/medium-grit ( 100 mm ) diamond bur , and brackets were bonded. Shear bond strengths and ARI scores were compared with those of groups 3 , 6. Results : On CAD-Temp® significantly higher bracket bond strengths than on Telio® CAD were recorded. With XTP significantly lower levels of adhesion were reached than using SU or AP. Roughening with a coarser bur resulted in a significant increase in adhesion. Conclusions : Bracket bonding to CAD/CAM PMMA can be promoted by grinding the substrate with a normal/medium-grit bur or by coating the intact surface with universal adhesives. With appropriate pretreatments , bracket adhesion to CAD/CAM PMMA temporary restorations can be enhanced to clinically satisfactory levels . Objective : Patients ' and parents ' expectations are important in orthodontic treatment decision making. The literature generally demonstrates the perceived benefits of orthodontic treatment , but patients ' and their parents ' concerns about orthodontic treatment have not been investigated comprehensively. The aim of this study was to identify patients ' and parents ' concerns about orthodontic treatment and compare them according to sex , age , and treatment demand level. Methods : One hundred and eighty-nine children and their parents were interviewed about concerns related to orthodontic treatment. Patients and parents were asked about orthodontic treatment decisions. Answers were recorded as `` yes , '' `` no , '' or `` do n't know. '' Chi-squared and Fisher 's exact tests were used to compare concerns between age groups , sexes , and treatment demand levels. Kappa statistics were used to assess agreement between patients and their parents. Results : Concerns about orthodontic treatment were gathered under 10 items as follows : `` feeling pain , '' `` the appearance of braces , '' `` being teased , '' `` avoiding smiling , '' `` speech problems , '' `` dietary changes , '' `` problems with transportation , '' `` economic problems , '' `` long treatment duration , '' and `` missing school. '' There was no statistically significant difference in concerns between the sexes or age groups. Some concern items and treatment demand were inversely related in patients. Conclusions : The results of this study demonstrate patients ' and parents ' concerns about orthodontic treatment. Differences between the concerns of patients with different treatment demands imply that children might reject orthodontic treatment because of their concerns. Appropriate consultation of patients addressing their concerns may help reduce anxiety and improve the acceptance of treatment . Objective : The aim of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the stability of the skeletal and dental widths using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) after segmental Le Fort I osteotomy in adult patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion requiring maxillary expansion. Methods : In total , 25 and 36 patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion underwent Le Fort I osteotomy ( control group ) and segmental Le Fort I osteotomy ( experimental group ) , respectively. Coronal CBCT images were used to measure the dental and skeletal widths before ( T1 ) and after ( T2 ) surgery and at the end of treatment ( T3 ) . The correlation between the extent of surgery and the amount of relapse in the experimental group was also determined. Results : In the control group , the dental width exhibited a significant decrease of 0.70 ± 1.28 mm between T3 and T2. In the experimental group , dental and skeletal expansion of 1.83 ± 1.66 and 2.55 ± 1.94 mm , respectively , was observed between T2 and T1. The mean changes in the dental and skeletal widths between T3 and T2 were -1.41 ± 1.98 and -0.67 ± 0.72 mm , respectively. There was a weak correlation between the amount of skeletal expansion during segmental Le Fort I osteotomy and the amount of postoperative skeletal relapse in the experimental group. Conclusions : Maxillary expansion via segmental Le Fort I osteotomy showed good stability , with a skeletal relapse rate of 26.3 % over approximately 12 months. Our results suggest that a greater amount of expansion requires greater efforts for the prevention of relapse . In this report , we describe the successful use of alternate rapid maxillary expansions and constrictions with a hybrid hyrax-mandibular miniplate combination and simultaneous orthodontic treatment for the management of severe Class III malocclusion due to maxillary hypoplasia in an 11-year-old girl. The devices were removed after 20 months of treatment , and the family was instructed about a careful control and retention program that should be followed in accordance with the patient 's growth. The final result included the correction of Class III malocclusion with adequate function and excellent facial esthetics , which restored the patient 's self-esteem and provided personal motivation. The outcomes showed good stability after 24 months of retention. The decrease in the duration of active treatment is the most important finding from the present case. Considering that facial esthetics in adolescence is a determining factor for the development of a personality and interpersonal relationships , we recommend the use of this protocol for growing patients , who will exhibit not only an improved physical appearance but also a better quality of life . Objective : The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal expansion ( MARPE ) on changes in airflow in the upper airway ( UA ) of an adult patient with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) using computational fluid-structure interaction analysis. Methods : Three-dimensional UA models fabricated from cone beam computed tomography images obtained before ( T0 ) and after ( T1 ) MARPE in an adult patient with OSAS were used for computational fluid dynamics with fluid-structure interaction analysis. Seven and nine cross-sectional planes ( interplane distance of 10 mm ) in the nasal cavity ( NC ) and pharynx , respectively , were set along UA. Changes in the cross-sectional area and changes in airflow velocity and pressure , node displacement , and total resistance at maximum inspiration ( MI ) , rest , and maximum expiration ( ME ) were investigated at each plane after MARPE. Results : The cross-sectional areas at most planes in NC and the upper half of the pharynx were significantly increased at T1. Moreover , airflow velocity decreased in the anterior NC at MI and ME and in the nasopharynx and oropharynx at MI. The decrease in velocity was greater in NC than in the pharynx. The airflow pressure in the anterior NC and entire pharynx exhibited a decrease at T1. The amount of node displacement in NC and the pharynx was insignificant at both T0 and T1. Absolute values for the total resistance at MI , rest , and ME were lower at T1 than at T0. Conclusions : MARPE improves airflow and decreases resistance in UA ; therefore , it may be an effective treatment modality for adult patients with moderate OSAS . Objective : To compare postoperative positional changes in the mandibular proximal segment between the conventional orthognathic surgery ( CS ) and the surgery-first approach ( SF ) using intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy ( IVRO ) in patients with Class III malocclusion. Methods : Thirty-eight patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion who underwent bimaxillary surgery were divided into two groups according to the use of preoperative orthodontic treatment : CS group ( n = 18 ) and SF group ( n = 20 ) . Skeletal changes in both groups were measured using computed tomography before ( T0 ) , 2 days after ( T1 ) , and 1 year after ( T2 ) the surgery. Three-dimensional ( 3D ) angular changes in the mandibular proximal segment , condylar position , and maxillomandibular landmarks were assessed. Results : The mean amounts of mandibular setback and maxillary posterior impaction were similar in both groups. At T2 , the posterior portion of the mandible moved upward in both groups. In the SF group , the anterior portion of the mandible moved upward by a mean distance of 0.9 ± 1.0 mm , which was statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) . There were significant between-group differences in occlusal changes ( p < 0.001 ) as well as in overjet and overbite. However , there were no significant between-group differences in proximal segment variables. Conclusions : Despite postoperative occlusal changes , positional changes in the mandibular proximal segment and the position of the condyles were similar between CS and SF , which suggested that SF using IVRO achieved satisfactory postoperative stability. If active physiotherapy is conducted , the proximal segment can be adapted in the physiological position regardless of the occlusal changes . The aim of this study was to test the clinical application of an intraoral scanner for serial evaluation of orthodontic tooth movement. The maxillary dentitions of eight patients with fixed orthodontic appliances were scanned using an intraoral scanner at the beginning of treatment ( T0 ) , and at 1 month ( T1 ) , 2 months ( T2 ) , 3 months ( T3 ) , and 4 months ( T4 ) after T0. The serial digital models were superimposed on the palatal surface as a reference area , and the linear and angular changes of the central incisors , canines , and first molars were evaluated. The intraclass correlation coefficient and method errors showed that this method was clinically acceptable. Various types of orthodontic tooth movements , including minute movements , could be observed every month. The intraoral scanner and digital superimposition technique enabled the serial evaluation of orthodontic tooth movement without taking serial impressions and/or acquiring radiographs . Objective : The aim of this study was to determine the optimal loading conditions for pure intrusion of the six maxillary anterior teeth with miniscrews according to alveolar bone loss. Methods : A three-dimensional finite element model was created for a segment of the six anterior teeth , and the positions of the miniscrews and hooks were varied after setting the alveolar bone loss to 0 , 2 , or 4 mm. Under 100 g of intrusive force , initial displacement of the individual teeth in three directions and the degree of labial tilting were measured. Results : The degree of labial tilting increased with reduced alveolar bone height under the same load. When a miniscrew was inserted between the two central incisors , the amounts of medial-lateral and anterior-posterior displacement of the central incisor were significantly greater than in the other conditions. When the miniscrews were inserted distally to the canines and an intrusion force was applied distal to the lateral incisors , the degree of labial tilting and the amounts of displacement of the six anterior teeth were the lowest , and the maximum von Mises stress was distributed evenly across all the teeth , regardless of the bone loss. Conclusions : Initial tooth displacement similar to pure intrusion of the six maxillary anterior teeth was induced when miniscrews were inserted distal to the maxillary canines and an intrusion force was applied distal to the lateral incisors. In this condition , the maximum von Mises stresses were relatively evenly distributed across all the teeth , regardless of the bone loss . Objective : To investigate the effects of the long-term use of a maxillary protraction facemask with miniplate ( FM-MP ) on pharyngeal airway dimensions in growing patients with cleft lip and palate ( CLP ) . Methods : The study included 24 boys with CLP ( mean age , 12.2 years ; mean duration of FM-MP therapy , 4.9 years ) , divided into two groups according to the amount of A point advancement to the vertical reference plane ( VRP ) : Group 1 , > 4 mm ; Group 2 , < 2 mm ; n = 12/group. After evaluating the skeletodental and airway variables using lateral cephalograms acquired before and after FM-MP therapy , statistical analyses were performed. Results : Group 1 showed greater forward and downward displacements of the posterior maxilla ( posterior nasal spine [ PNS ] -horizontal reference plane [ HRP ] ; PNSVRP ) , greater increase in ANB , more forward tongue position ( tongue tip-Pt vertical line to Frankfort horizontal plane ) , and greater increase in the oropharynx ( superior posterior airway space [ SPAS ] ; middle airway space [ MAS ] ) and upper nasopharynx ( PNS-adenoid2 ) than did Group 2. While maxillary advancement ( A-VRP and PNS-VRP ) correlated with increases in SPAS , MAS , and PNS-adenoid2 , downward displacement of the PNS ( PNS-HRP ) correlated with increases in SPAS , MAS , PNSadenoid1 , and PNS-adenoid2 , and with a decrease in vertical airway length ( VAL ) . Mandibular forward displacement and decrease in mandibular plane correlated with increases in MAS. Conclusions : FM-MP therapy had positive effects on the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airway spaces without increases in VAL in Group 1 rather than in Group 2. However , further validation using an untreated control group is necessary . Skeletal anchorage-assisted upper molar distalization has become one of the standard treatment modalities for the correction of Class II malocclusion. The purpose of this study was to analyze maxillary molar movement patterns according to appliance design , with the simultaneous use of buccal fixed orthodontic appliances. The authors devised two distinct types of midpalatal miniscrew-assisted maxillary molar distalizers , a lingual arch type and a pendulum type. Fourteen patients treated with one of the two types of distalizers were enrolled in the study , and the patterns of tooth movement associated with each type were compared. Pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalograms were analyzed. The lingual arch type was associated with relatively bodily upper molar distalization , while the pendulum type was associated with distal tipping with intrusion of the upper molar. Clinicians should be aware of the expected tooth movement associated with each appliance design. Further well designed studies with larger sample sizes are required . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the dental and skeletal effects of the modified C-palatal plate ( MCPP ) for total arch distalization in adult patients with Class II malocclusion and compare the findings with those of cervical pull headgear. Methods : The study sample consisted of the lateral cephalograms of 44 adult patients with Class II Division 1 malocclusion , including 22 who received treatment with MCPP ( age , 24.7 ± 7.7 years ) and 22 who received treatment with cervical pull headgear ( age , 23.0 ± 7.7 years ) . Pre- ( T1 ) and post-treatment ( T2 ) cephalograms were analyzed for 24 linear and angular measurements. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the changes after treatment in each group and differences in treatment effects between the two groups. Results : The mean amount of distalization at the crown and root levels of the maxillary first molar and the amount of distal tipping was 4.2 mm , 3.5 mm , and 3.9° in the MCPP group , and 2.3 mm , 0.6 mm , and 8.6° in the headgear group , respectively. In addition , intrusion by 2.5 mm was observed in the MCPP group. In both groups , the distal movement of the upper lip and the increase in the nasolabial angle were statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) . However , none of the skeletal and soft tissue variables exhibited significant differences between the two groups. Conclusions : The results of this study suggest that MCPP is an effective treatment modality for total arch distalization in adults . Objective : This study aimed to quantitatively assess the relationship of smile esthetic variables with various types of malocclusion , and identify the cephalometric factors affecting smile measurements. Methods : This retrospective study included 106 patients who were treated with retention at the orthodontic department of Taipei Medical University Hospital. Hard-tissue variables were measured using lateral cephalographic tracings , and nine smile esthetic variables were measured using facial photographs. The patients were divided into three groups according to their overjet ( < 0 , 0-4 , and > 4 mm ) . An analysis of variance was conducted to compare the pretreatment cephalometric variables and smile esthetic variables among the three groups. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the cephalometric factors affecting the smile measurements in each group. Results : Except the upper midline and buccal corridor ratio , all of the smile measurements differed significantly among the three groups before orthodontic treatment. Some of the smile characteristics were correlated with the cephalometric measurements in different types of malocclusion. The overjet was the major factor influencing the smile pattern in all three types of malocclusion. Conclusions : Smile characteristics differ between different types of malocclusion ; the smile may be influenced by skeletal pattern , dental procumbency , or facial type. These findings indicate that establishment of an optimal horizontal anterior teeth relationship is the key to improving the smile characteristics in different types of malocclusion . Objective : Three-dimensional ( 3D ) printing is a recent technological development that may play a significant role in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment. It can be used to fabricate skull models or study models , as well as to make replica teeth in autotransplantation or tooth impaction cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of fabrication of replica teeth made by two types of 3D printing technologies. Methods : Fifty extracted molar teeth were selected as samples. They were scanned to generate high-resolution 3D surface model stereolithography files. These files were converted into physical models using two types of 3D printing technologies : Fused deposition modeling ( FDM ) and PolyJet technology. All replica teeth were scanned and 3D images generated. Computer software compared the replica teeth to the original teeth with linear measurements , volumetric measurements , and mean deviation measurements with best-fit alignment. Paired t-tests were used to statistically analyze the measurements. Results : Most measurements of teeth formed using FDM tended to be slightly smaller , while those of the PolyJet replicas tended to be slightly larger , than those of the extracted teeth. Mean deviation measurements with best-fit alignment of FDM and PolyJet group were 0.047 mm and 0.038 mm , respectively. Although there were statistically significant differences , they were regarded as clinically insignificant. Conclusions : This study confirms that FDM and PolyJet technologies are accurate enough to be usable in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment . Objective : This study was performed to investigate the changes in alveolar bone after maxillary incisor intrusion and to determine the related factors in deep-bite patients. Methods : Fifty maxillary central incisors of 25 patients were evaluated retrospectively. The maxillary incisors in Group I ( 12 patients ; mean age , 16.51 ± 1.32 years ) were intruded with a base-arch , while those in Group II ( 13 patients ; mean age , 17.47 ± 2.71 years ) were intruded with miniscrews. Changes in the alveolar envelope were assessed using pre-intrusion and post-intrusion cone-beam computed tomography images. Labial , palatal , and total bone thicknesses were evaluated at the crestal ( 3 mm ) , midroot ( 6 mm ) , and apical ( 9 mm ) levels. Buccal and palatal alveolar crestal height , buccal bone height , and the prevalence of dehiscence were evaluated. Two-way repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine the significance of the changes. Pearson 's correlation coefficient analysis was performed to assess the relationship between dental and alveolar bone measurement changes. Results : Upper incisor inclination and intrusion changes were significantly greater in Group II than in Group I. With treatment , the alveolar bone thickness at the labial bone thickness ( LBT , 3 and 6 mm ) decreased significantly in Group II ( p < 0.001 ) as compared to Group I. The LBT change at 3 mm was strongly and positively correlated with the amount of upper incisor intrusion ( r = 0.539 ; p= 0.005 ) . Conclusions : Change in the labial inclination and the amount of intrusion should be considered during upper incisor intrusion , as these factors increase the risk of alveolar bone loss . Objective : In accordance with the changing demographics in the United States , orthodontists working on various ethnic populations should be more conscious when using the standardized profile analyses for the African American patient. The objective of this study was to examine whether the perception of lip protrusiveness in modern African American faces has changed. For this purpose , we investigated the most favorable African American lip profile using the opinions of 10 experienced and 10 newly trained younger orthodontists. Methods : Attractiveness was converted to a number on visualized analog scales. Comparative ranks on 16 African American profiles , with focus on lip protrusiveness and thickness , were made among the groups. Mixed-effects linear regression models were fit and group differences were estimated. Results : Younger orthodontists favored a more protrusive lip profile , and the variance in their perceptions was narrower than those of older orthodontists. Measurements related to upper lip protrusion showed the strongest correlation to attractiveness ( r = -0.82 ) . The association with attractiveness decreased linearly as the protrusiveness of the upper lip increased. Steiner 's E-line was the most influential reference for determining the level of attractiveness for the older orthodontists , whereas upper lip protrusion was the most influential factor for the young orthodontists. Conclusions : An adequate level of lip protrusiveness and thickness should be essential for maintaining attractive esthetics in African American patients. Yet , a new set of standards for prominent lips in this population is necessary to reflect the current trend in the concept of a beautiful face in the modern world . Objective : This study was performed to explore the effect of different bracket , archwire , and ligature combinations on resistance to sliding ( RS ) and rotational control in first-order angulation. Methods : Three types of brackets ( multi-level low friction [ MLF ] , self-ligating , and conventional brackets ) coupled with four nickel-titanium archwires ( 0.012 , 0.014 , 0.016 , and 0.018-inch diameter ) and two stainless steel ligatures ( 0.20 and 0.25 mm ) were tested in different first-order angulations ( 0° , 2° , 4° , 6° , 8° , 10° , 15° , 20° ) by using an Instron universal mechanical machine in the dry state at room temperature. RS value was evaluated and compared by one-way ANOVA. Results : Under the same angulation , the RS values showed the following order : conventional brackets > MLF brackets > self-ligating brackets. The RS was the highest for conventional brackets and showed a tendency to increase. The RS for MLF brackets coupled with thinner archwires and ligatures showed a similar tendency as the RS for the self-ligating bracket. In contrast , the RS for MLF brackets coupled with thicker archwires and ligatures increased like that for conventional brackets. MLF brackets showed the greatest range of critical contact angles in first-order angulation. Conclusions : The RS in first-order angulation is influenced by bracket design , archwire , and ligature dimension. In comparison with self-ligating and conventional brackets , MLF brackets could express low friction and rotational control with their greater range of critical contact angles . Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of orthodontic patients at Yonsei Dental Hospital from 2008 to 2012. Methods : We evaluated Angle 's classification from molar relationships , classification of skeletal malocclusion from the A point-nasion-B point angle , facial asymmetry , and temporomandibular joint disorders ( TMDs ) from the records of 7,476 patients who received an orthodontic diagnosis. The orthognathic surgery rate , extraction rate , and extraction sites were determined from the records of 4,861 treated patients. Results : The patient number increased until 2010 and gradually decreased thereafter. Most patients were aged 19-39 years , with a gradual increase in patients aged 40 years. Angle 's Class I , Class II divisions 1 and 2 , and Class III malocclusions were observed in 27.7 % , 25.6 % , 10.6 % , and 36.1 % patients , respectively , with a gradual decrease in the frequency of Class I malocclusion. The proportion of patients with skeletal Class I , Class II , and Class III malocclusions was 34.3 % , 34.3 % , and 31.4 % , respectively , while the prevalence of facial asymmetry and TMDs was 11.0 % and 24.9 % , respectively. The orthognathic surgery rate was 18.5 % , with 70 % surgical patients exhibiting skeletal Class III malocclusion. The overall extraction rate among nonsurgical patients was 35.4 % , and the maxillary and mandibular first premolars were the most commonly extracted teeth. Conclusions : The most noticeable changes over time included a decrease in the patient number after 2010 , an increase in the average patient age , and a decrease in the frequency of Angle 's Class I malocclusion. Our results suggest that periodic characterization is necessary to meet the changing demands of orthodontic patients . Objective : A low-viscosity resin ( infiltrant ) was used to inhibit the progression of white spot lesions ( WSLs ) and resolve associated esthetic issues. An alternative pretreatment was explored to increase the pore volume of the surface layer of the WSLs. Also , the penetration effects of the infiltrant were evaluated for various pretreatments. Methods : Sixty two artificial lesions were fabricated on bovine teeth. As a positive control , 15 % HCl gel was applied for 120 seconds. Further , 37 % H3PO4 gel was applied for 30 seconds using three methods. The samples were divided as follows : H3PO4 only group , H3PO4 sponge group , and H3PO4 brush group. The acid was gently rubbed with the applicators ( i.e. , a sponge or brush ) throughout the application time. To compare the effects of resin infiltration , twenty paired halves of specimens were treated with an infiltrant ( ICON® ) . Results : Thicknesses of the removed surface layers and infiltrated areas were evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscope. The positive control and the 37 % H3PO4 brush group failed to show significant differences in the removed thickness ( p > 0.05 ) ; however , the mean percentage of the infiltrated area was higher in the 37 % H3PO4 brush group ( 84.13 ± 7.58 % ) than the positive control ( 63.51 ± 7.62 % , p < 0.001 ) . Scanning electron microscope observations indicate higher pore volumes for the 37 % H3PO4 brush group than for the positive control. Conclusions : Application of 37 % H3PO4 with a brush for 30 seconds increased the pore volume of WSL surface layers and the percentage of infiltrated areas in comparison to the use of 15 % HCl for 120 seconds . Objective : In our previous study , glass-fiber-reinforced plastics ( GFRPs ) made from polycarbonate and glass fibers were prepared for esthetic orthodontic wires using pultrusion. These laboratory GFRP wires are more transparent than the commercially available nickel-titanium wire ; however , an investigation of the color stability of GFRP during orthodontic treatment is needed. Accordingly , in the present study , the color stability of GFRP was assessed using colorimetry. Methods : Preparation of GFRP esthetic round wires ( diameter : 0.45 mm [ 0.018 inch ] ) using pultrusion was described previously. Here , to investigate how the diameter of fiber reinforcement affects color stability , GFRPs were prepared by incorporating either 13-µm ( GFRP-13 ) or 7-µm glass ( GFRP-7 ) fibers. The color changes of GFRPs after 24 h , and following 1 , 2 , and 4 weeks of coffee immersion at 37 , were measured by colorimetry. We evaluated the color stability of GFRPs by two evaluating units : the color difference ( E ( * ) ) and National Bureau of Standards ( NBS ) . Results : After immersion , both GFRPs showed almost no visible color change. According to the colorimetry measurements , the E ( * ) values of GFRP-13 and GFRP-7 were 0.73-1.16 , and 0.62-1.10 , respectively. In accordance with NBS units , both GFRPs showed `` slight '' color changes. As a result , there were no significant differences in the E ( * ) values or NBS units for GFRP-13 or GFRP-7. Moreover , for both GFRPs , no significant differences were observed in any of the immersion periods. Conclusions : Our findings suggest that the GFRPs will maintain high color stability during orthodontic treatment , and are an attractive prospect as esthetic orthodontic wires . Moving the mandibular posterior teeth into a severely atrophic edentulous space is a challenge. A carefully designed force-and-moment system that results in bodily protraction of the posterior teeth with balanced bone resorption and apposition is needed in such cases. This report describes the treatment of a 19-year-old woman with missing mandibular first molars due to juvenile periodontitis. Miniscrews were used as absolute anchorage during protraction of the mandibular second and third molars. Bodily mesial movement of the mandibular second and third molars was achieved over a distance of 11 to 17 mm after 39 months of orthodontic treatment . Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of heritability on the craniofacial soft tissue cephalometric characteristics of monozygotic ( MZ ) twins , dizygotic ( DZ ) twins , and their siblings ( SIB ) . Methods : The samples comprised Korean adult twins and their siblings ( mean age , 39.8 years ; MZ group , n = 36 pairs ; DZ group , n = 13 pairs of the same gender ; and SIB group , n = 26 pairs of the same gender ) . Thirty cephalometric variables were measured to characterize facial profile , facial height , soft-tissue thickness , and projection of nose and lip. Falconer 's method was used to calculate heritability ( low heritability , h2 < 0.2 ; high heritability , h2 > 0.9 ) . After principal components analysis ( PCA ) was performed to extract the models , we calculated the intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) value and heritability of each component. Results : The MZ group exhibited higher ICC values for all cephalometric variables than DZ and SIB groups. Among cephalometric variables , the highest h2 ( MZ-DZ ) and h2 ( MZ-SIB ) values were observed for the nasolabial angle ( NLA , 1.544 and 2.036 ) , chin angle ( 1.342 and 1.112 ) , soft tissue chin thickness ( 2.872 and 1.226 ) , and upper lip thickness ratio ( 1.592 and 1.026 ) . PCA derived eight components with 84.5 % of a cumulative explanation. The components that exhibited higher values of h2 ( MZ-DZ ) and h2 ( MZ-SIB ) were PCA2 , which includes facial convexity , NLA , and nose projection ( 1.026 and 0.972 ) , and PCA7 , which includes chin angle and soft tissue chin thickness ( 2.107 and 1.169 ) . Conclusions : The nose and soft tissue chin were more influenced by genetic factors than other soft tissues . Objective : To standardize the facial soft-tissue characteristics of South Korean adults according to gender by measuring the soft-tissue thickness of young men and women with normal facial profiles by using three-dimensional ( 3D ) reconstructed models. Methods : Computed tomographic images of 22 men aged 20 - 27 years and 18 women aged 20 - 26 years with normal facial profiles were obtained. The hard and soft tissues were three-dimensionally reconstructed by using Mimics software. The soft-tissue thickness was measured from the underlying bony surface at bilateral ( frontal eminence , supraorbital , suborbital , inferior malar , lateral orbit , zygomatic arch , supraglenoid , gonion , supraM2 , occlusal line , and subM2 ) and midline ( supraglabella , glabella , nasion , rhinion , mid-philtrum , supradentale , infradentale , supramentale , mental eminence , and menton ) landmarks. Results : The men showed significantly thicker soft tissue at the supraglabella , nasion , rhinion , mid-philtrum , supradentale , and supraglenoid points. In the women , the soft tissue was significantly thicker at the lateral orbit , inferior malar , and gonion points. Conclusions : The soft-tissue thickness in different facial areas varies according to gender. Orthodontists should use a different therapeutic approach for each gender . Objective : The aim of this trial was to compare the alignment efficiency and intermaxillary arch dimension changes of nickel-titanium ( NiTi ) or copper-nickel-titanium ( CuNiTi ) round archwires with increasing diameters applied sequentially to the mandibular arch. Methods : The initial alignment phase of fixed orthodontic treatment with NiTi or CuNiTi round archwires was studied in a randomly allocated sample of 66 patients. The NiTi group comprised 26 women , 10 men , and the CuNiTi ( 27 ) group comprised 20 women , 10 men. The eligibility criteria were as follows : anterior mandibular crowding of minimum 6 mm according to Little 's Irregularity Index ( LII ) , treatment requiring no extraction of premolars , 12 to 18 years of age , permanent dentition , skeletal and dental Class I malocclusion. The main outcome measure was the alignment of the mandibular anterior dentition ; the secondary outcome measure was the change in mandibular dental arch dimensions during 12 weeks. Simple randomization ( allocation ratio 1:1 ) was used in this single-blind study. LII and mandibular arch dimensions were measured on three-dimensional digital dental models at 2-week intervals. Results : No statistically significant difference was observed between NiTi and CuNiTi according to LII ( p > 0.05 ) . Intercanine and intermolar arch perimeters increased in the CuNiTi group ( p < 0.001 ) . Inter-first premolar width showed a statistically significant interaction in week _ diameter _ application ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : The effects of NiTi and CuNiTi round archwires were similar in terms of their alignment efficiency. However , the intercanine and intermolar arch perimeters , and the inter-first premolar width changes differed between groups . Objective : Treating Class II subdivision malocclusion with asymmetry has been a challenge for orthodontists because of the complicated characteristics of asymmetry. This study aimed to explore the characteristics of dental and skeletal asymmetry in Class II subdivision malocclusion , and to assess the relationship between the condyle-glenoid fossa and first molar. Methods : Cone-beam computed tomographic images of 32 patients with Class II subdivision malocclusion were three-dimensionally reconstructed using the Mimics software. Forty-five anatomic landmarks on the reconstructed structures were selected and 27 linear and angular measurements were performed. Paired-samplest-tests were used to compare the average differences between the Class I and Class II sides ; Pearson correlation coefficient ( r ) was used for analyzing the linear association. Results : The faciolingual crown angulation of the mandibular first molar ( p < 0.05 ) , sagittal position of the maxillary and mandibular first molars ( p < 0.01 ) , condylar head height ( p < 0.01 ) , condylar process height ( p < 0.05 ) , and angle of the posterior wall of the articular tubercle and coronal position of the glenoid fossa ( p < 0.01 ) were significantly different between the two sides. The morphology and position of the condyle-glenoid fossa significantly correlated with the three-dimensional changes in the first molar. Conclusions : Asymmetry in the sagittal position of the maxillary and mandibular first molars between the two sides and significant lingual inclination of the mandibular first molar on the Class II side were the dental characteristics of Class II subdivision malocclusion. Condylar morphology and glenoid fossa position asymmetries were the major components of skeletal asymmetry and were well correlated with the three-dimensional position of the first molar . Objective : The purpose of this study was to analyze initial displacement and stress distribution of the maxillofacial complex during dentoskeletal maxillary protraction with various appliance designs placed on the palatal region by using three-dimensional finite element analysis. Methods : Six models of maxillary protraction were developed : conventional facemask ( Type A ) , facemask with dentoskeletal hybrid anchorage ( Type B ) , facemask with a palatal plate ( Type C ) , intraoral traction using a Class III palatal plate ( Type D ) , facemask with a palatal plate combined with rapid maxillary expansion ( RME ; Type E ) , and Class III palatal plate intraoral traction with RME ( Type F ) . In Types A , B , C , and D , maxillary protraction alone was performed , whereas in Types E and F , transverse expansion was performed simultaneously with maxillary protraction. Results : Type C displayed the greatest amount of anterior dentoskeletal displacement in the sagittal plane. Types A and B resulted in similar amounts of anterior displacement of all the maxillofacial landmarks. Type D showed little movement , but Type E with expansion and the palatal plate displayed a larger range of movement of the maxillofacial landmarks in all directions. Conclusions : The palatal plate served as an effective skeletal anchor for use with the facemask in maxillary protraction. In contrast , the intraoral use of Class III palatal plates showed minimal skeletal and dental effects in maxillary protraction. In addition , palatal expansion with the protraction force showed minimal effect on the forward movement of the maxillary complex . Objective : The aim of this study was to assess the analgesic effect of a single application of low-level laser therapy ( LLLT ) on spontaneous pain and pain on chewing after placement of initial archwires. Methods : Forty-two patients ( 26 women , 16 men ) were randomly recruited for this split-mouth randomized clinical trial. Each patient received super-elastic nickel-titanium ( NiTi ) initial archwires ( 0.012 , 0.014 , 0.016 , and 0.018-inch [ in ] ) in the maxilla for leveling and alignment for an interval of 4 weeks between archwires. One side of the mouth was randomly designated as experimental , while the other side served as placebo. After insertion of each archwire , the experimental side was irradiated with a diode laser for 3 seconds each on 5 points facially and palatally per tooth , from the central incisor to first molar. On the placebo side , the laser device was held the same way but without laser application. A numerical rating scale was used to assess the intensity of spontaneous and masticatory pain for the following 7 days. The Mann-WhitneyUtest was used to compare pain scores between sides. Results : Patients in the LLLT group exhibited significantly lower mean scores for spontaneous pain after insertion of the initial two archwires ( 0.012-in and 0.014-in NiTi ; p < 0.05 ) , while there was no significant difference for 0.016-in and 0.018-in wires between the LLLT and placebo groups. LLLT significantly reduced chewing pain scores ( p < 0.05 ) for all archwires. Conclusions : A single dose of LLLT considerably lessened postoperative pain accompanying the placement of super-elastic NiTi wires for initial alignment and leveling . Objective : The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of cetirizine , a histamine 1 receptor antagonist , on bone remodeling after calvarial suture expansion. Methods : Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups ; the phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) -injected no expansion group , cetirizine-injected no expansion group , PBS-injected expansion group , and cetirizine-injected expansion group , and were observed at 7 , 14 , and 28 days. Five rats per group were examined at each observation day. Daily injections of cetirizine or PBS were administered to the relevant groups starting 2 weeks prior to expander insertion. A rapid expander was inserted in the calvarial bone to deliver 100 cN of force to the parietal suture. The specimens were prepared for hematoxylin and eosin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) staining. Suture opening and bone regeneration were evaluated using microcomputed tomography and bone histomorphometric analysis. Serum blood levels of osteocalcin and carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks ( CTX ) were also evaluated. Results : TRAP-positive cell counts and CTX levels decreased while osteocalcin levels increased in the cetirizine-injected expansion group at observation day 28. In the expansion groups , the mineralized area gradually increased throughout the observation period. At day 28 , the cetirizine-injected expansion group showed greater bone volume density , greater mineralized area , and narrower average suture width than did the PBS-injected expansion group. Conclusions : Cetirizine injection facilitated bone formation after suture expansion , mostly by suppressing osteoclastic activity. Histamine 1 receptor antagonists may aid in bone formation after calvarial suture expansion in the rat model . The purpose of this case report was to introduce the concept of orthodontic and orthopedic treatment for a growing patient with Tessier number 0 cleft. A 5-year-old boy patient with Tessier number 0 cleft presented congenitally missing maxillary central incisors ( MXCI ) , a bony defect at the premaxilla , a constricted maxillary arch , an anterior openbite , and maxillary hypoplasia. His treatment was divided into three stages : management of the bony defect at the premaxilla and the congenitally missing MXCIs using a fan-type expansion plate , iliac bone grafting , and eruption guidance of the maxillary lateral incisors into the graft area for substitution of MXCIs ; management of the maxillary hypoplasia using sequential facemask therapy with conventional and skeletal anchorage ; and management of the remaining occlusal problems using fixed orthodontic treatment. The total treatment duration was 15 years and 10 months. Class I canine and Class II molar relationships and normal overbite and overjet were achieved at the end of treatment. Although the long-term use of facemask therapy resulted in significant protraction of the retrusive maxilla , the patient exhibited Class III profile because of continued mandibular growth. However , the treatment result was well maintained after 2 years of retention. The findings from this case suggest that interdisciplinary and customized approaches are mandatory for successful management of maxillary hypoplasia , bony defect , and dental problems in Tessier number 0 cleft. Moreover , considering the potential of orthognathic surgery or distraction osteogenesis , meticulous monitoring of mandibular growth until growth completion is important . As an alternative to the conventional fixed appliance that uses orthodontic brackets , a simple round tube without a bonding base can be bonded to the tooth surface by covering the tube with flowable resin. In this technique , bent wires can not be inserted into the simple tubes ; therefore , repositioning of the simple tubes is often required for adjustments. To reduce repositioning of simple tubes , a dome-shaped resin covering of the simple tube can be designed with a customized in-and-out compensation , using three-dimensional computer-aided design software based on digital simulation of orthodontic tooth movement. In the present case , the use of simple tubes bonded with customized resin coverings in a Class I nonextraction case is described in a 17-year-old male , in whom moderate crowding of the anterior teeth was treated over an 8-month period. This case shows that simple tubes can be used as an alternative to brackets in some Class I nonextraction cases , with the potential benefit of reducing decalcification . Objective : This paper describes changes in the characteristics of patients seeking orthodontic treatment over the past decade and the treatment they received , to identify any seasonal variations or trends. Methods : This single-center retrospective cohort study included all patients who presented to Seoul National University Dental Hospital for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment between January 1 , 2005 and December 31 , 2015. The study analyzed a set of heterogeneous variables grouped into the following categories : demographic ( age , gender , and address ) , clinical ( Angle Classification , anomaly , mode of orthodontic treatment , removable appliances for Phase 1 treatment , fixed appliances for Phase 2 treatment , orthognathic surgery , extraction , mini-plate , mini-implant , and patient transfer ) and time-related variables ( date of first visit and orthodontic treatment time ) . Time series analysis was applied to each variable. Results : The sample included 14,510 patients with a median age of 19.5 years. The number of patients and their ages demonstrated a clear seasonal variation , which peaked in the summer and winter. Increasing trends were observed for the proportion of male patients , use of non-extraction treatment modality , use of ceramic brackets , patients from provinces outside the Seoul region at large , patients transferred from private practitioners , and patients who underwent orthognathic surgery performed by university surgeons. Decreasing trends included the use of metal brackets and orthodontic treatment time. Conclusions : Time series analysis revealed a seasonal variation in some characteristics , and several variables showed changing trends over the past decade . Objective : The purpose of this study was to observe stress distribution and displacement patterns of the entire maxillary arch with regard to distalizing force vectors applied from interdental miniscrews. Methods : A standard three-dimensional finite element model was constructed to simulate the maxillary teeth , periodontal ligament , and alveolar process. The displacement of each tooth was calculated on x , y , and z axes , and the von Mises stress distribution was visualized using color-coded scales. Results : A single distalizing force at the archwire level induced lingual inclination of the anterior segment , and slight intrusive distal tipping of the posterior segment. In contrast , force at the high level of the retraction hook resulted in lingual root movement of the anterior segment , and extrusive distal translation of the posterior segment. As the force application point was located posteriorly along the archwire , the likelihood of extrusive lingual inclination of the anterior segment increased , and the vertical component of the force led to intrusion and buccal tipping of the posterior segment. Rotation of the occlusal plane was dependent on the relationship between the line of force and the possible center of resistance of the entire arch. Conclusions : Displacement of the entire arch may be dictated by a direct relationship between the center of resistance of the whole arch and the line of action generated between the miniscrews and force application points at the archwire , which makes the total arch movement highly predictable . Objective : The purposes of this study were to measure the orthodontic forces generated by thermoplastic aligners and investigate the possible influences of different activations for lingual bodily movements on orthodontic forces , and their attenuation. Methods : Thermoplastic material of 1.0-mm in thickness was used to manufacture aligners for 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , and 0.6 mm activations for lingual bodily movements of the maxillary central incisor. The orthodontic force in the lingual direction delivered by the thermoplastic aligners was measured using a micro-stress sensor system for the invisible orthodontic technique , and was monitored for 2 weeks. Results : Orthodontic force increased with the amount of activation of the aligner in the initial measurements. The attenuation speed in the 0.6 mm group was faster than that of the other groups ( p < 0.05 ) . All aligners demonstrated rapid relaxation in the first 8 hours , which then decreased slowly and plateaued on day 4 or 5. Conclusions : The amount of activation had a substantial influence on the orthodontic force imparted by the aligners. The results suggest that the activation of lingual bodily movement of the maxillary central incisor should not exceed 0.5 mm. The initial 4 or 5 days is important with respect to orthodontic treatment incorporating an aligner . Objective : The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of carbonated water on etched or sealed enamel according to the carbonation level and the presence of calcium ions. Methods : Carbonated water with different carbonation levels was manufactured by a soda carbonator. Seventy-five premolar teeth were randomly divided into a control group and 4 experimental groups in accordance with the carbonation level and the presence of calcium ions in the test solutions. After specimen preparation of the Unexposed , Etched , and Sealed enamel subgroups , all the specimens were submerged in each test solution for 15 minutes three times a day during 7 days. Microhardness tests on the Unexposed and Etched enamel subgroups were performed with 10 specimens from each group. Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) tests on the Unexposed , Etched , and Sealed enamel subgroups were performed with 5 specimens from each group. Microhardness changes in different groups were statistically compared using pairedt-tests , the Wilcoxon signed rank test , and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results : The microhardness changes were significantly different between the groups ( p= 0.000 ) . The microhardness changes in all experimental groups except Group 3 ( low-level carbonated water with calcium ions ) were significantly greater than those in the Control group. SEM showed that etched areas of the specimen were affected by carbonated water and the magnitude of destruction varied between groups. Adhesive material was partially removed in groups exposed to carbonated water. Conclusions : Carbonated water has negative effects on etched or sealed enamel , resulting in decreased microhardness and removal of the adhesive material . Objective : The aim of this study was to investigate three-dimensional molar displacement after distalization via miniscrews and a horizontal modification of the trans-palatal-arch ( TPA ) . Methods : The subjects in this clinical trial were 26 Class II patients. After the preparation of a complete set of diagnostic records , miniscrews were inserted between the maxillary 2nd premolar and 1st molar on the palatal side. Elastic modules connected to the TPA exerting an average force of 150-200 g/side parallel to the occlusal plane were applied. Cone-beam computed tomography was utilized to evaluate the position of the miniscrews relative to the adjacent teeth and maxillary sinus , and the direction of force relative to molar furcation. The distances from the central point of the incisive papilla to the mesiopalatal cusps of the 1st maxillary molars and the distances between the mesiopalatal cusps of the left and right molars were measured to evaluate displacement of the maxillary molars on the horizontal plane. Interocclusal space was used to evaluate vertical changes. Results : Mean maxillary 1st molar distalization was 2.3 ± 1.1 mm , at a rate of 0.4 ± 0.2 mm/month , and rotation was not significant. Intermolar width increased by 2.9 ± 1.8 mm. Molars were intruded relative to the neighboring teeth , from 0.1 to 0.8 mm. Conclusions : Distalization of molars was possible without extrusion , using the appliance investigated. The intrusive component of force reduced the rate of distal movement . Objective : The primary objective of this study was to quantitatively analyze the bone parameters ( thickness and density ) at four different interdental areas from the distal region of the canine to the mesial region of the second molar in the maxilla and the mandible. The secondary aim was to compare and contrast the bone parameters at these specific locations in terms of sex , growth status , and facial type. Methods : This retrospective cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) study reviewed 290 CBCT images of patients seeking orthodontic treatment. Cortical bone thickness in millimeters ( mm ) and density in pixel intensity value were measured for the regions ( 1 ) between the canine and first premolar , ( 2 ) between the first and second premolars , ( 3 ) between the second premolar and first molar , and ( 4 ) between the first and second molars. At each location , the bone thickness and density were measured at distances of 2 , 6 , and 10 mm from the alveolar crest. Results : The sex comparison ( male vs. female ) in cortical bone thickness showed no significant difference ( p > 0.001 ) . The bone density in growing subjects was significantly ( p < 0.001 ) lower than that in non-growing subjects for most locations. There was no significant difference ( p > 0.001 ) in bone parameters in relation to facial pattern in the maxilla and mandible for most sites. Conclusions : There was no significant sex-related difference in cortical bone thickness. The buccal cortical bone density was higher in females than in males. Bone parameters were similar for subjects with hyperdivergent , hypodivergent , and normodivergent facial patterns . The treatment of skeletal Class III malocclusion in adolescents is challenging. Maxillary protraction , particularly that using bone anchorage , has been proven to be an effective method for the stimulation of maxillary growth. However , the conventional procedure , which involves the surgical implantation of mini-plates , is traumatic and associated with a high risk. Three-dimensional ( 3D ) digital technology offers the possibility of individualized treatment. Customized miniplates can be designed according to the shape of the maxillary surface and the positions of the roots on cone-beam computed tomography scans ; this reduces both the surgical risk and patient trauma. Here we report a case involving a 12-year-old adolescent girl with skeletal Class III malocclusion and midface deficiency that was treated in two phases. In phase 1 , rapid maxillary expansion and protraction were performed using 3D-printed mini-plates for anchorage. The mini-plates exhibited better adaptation to the bone contour , and titanium screw implantation was safer because of the customized design. The orthopedic force applied to each mini-plate was approximately 400-500 g , and the plates remained stable during the maxillary protraction process , which exhibited efficacious orthopedic effects and significantly improved the facial profile and esthetics. In phase 2 , fixed appliances were used for alignment and leveling of the maxillary and mandibular dentitions. The complete two-phase treatment lasted for 24 months. After 48 months of retention , the treatment outcomes remained stable . Objective : Orthodontic root resorption ( ORR ) due to orthodontic tooth movement is a difficult treatment-related adverse event. Caspases are important effector molecules for apoptosis. At present , little is known about the mechanisms underlying ORR and apoptosis in the cementum. The aim of the presentin vivostudy was to investigate the expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) , caspase 3 , caspase 8 , and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand ( RANKL ) in the cementum in response to a heavy or an optimum orthodontic force. Methods : The maxillary molars of male Wistar rats were subjected to an orthodontic force of 10 g or 50 g using a closed coil spring. The rats were sacrificed each experimental period on days 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 after orthodontic force application. And the rats were subjected to histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Results : On day 7 for the 50-g group , hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed numerous root resorption lacunae with odontoclasts on the root , while immunohistochemistry showed increased TRAP- and RANKL-positive cells. Caspase 3- and caspase 8-positive cells were increased on the cementum surfaces in the 50-g group on days 3 and 5. Moreover , the number of caspase 3- and caspase 8-positive cells and RANKL-positive cells was significantly higher in the 50-g group than in the 10-g group. Conclusions : In our rat model , ORR occurred after apoptosis was induced in the cementum by a heavy orthodontic force. These findings suggest that apoptosis of cementoblasts is involved in ORR . Objective : With the introduction of third-generation light-emitting diodes ( LEDs ) in dental practice , it is necessary to compare their bracket-bonding effects , safety , and efficacy with those of the second-generation units. Methods : In this study , 80 extracted human premolars were randomly divided into eight groups of 10 samples each. Metal or polycrystalline ceramic brackets were bonded on the teeth using second- or third-generation LED light-curing units ( LCUs ) , according to the manufacturers ' instructions. The shear bond strengths were measured using the universal testing machine , and the adhesive remnant index ( ARI ) was scored by assessing the residual resin on the surfaces of debonded teeth using a scanning electron microscope. In addition , curing times were also measured. Results : The shear bond strengths in all experimental groups were higher than the acceptable clinical shear bond strengths , regardless of the curing unit used. In both LED LCU groups , all ceramic bracket groups showed significantly higher shear bond strengths than did the metal bracket groups except the plasma emulation group which showed no significant difference. When comparing units within the same bracket type , no differences in shear bond strength were observed between the second- and third-generation unit groups. Additionally , no significant differences were observed among the groups for the ARI. Conclusions : The bracket-bonding effects and ARIs of second- and third-generation LED LCUs showed few differences , and most were without statistical significance ; however , the curing time was shorter for the second-generation unit . Objective : Thisin-vivostudy aimed to compare landmark identification errors in anteroposterior ( AP ) and posteroanterior ( PA ) cephalograms generated from cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) scan data in order to examine the feasibility of using AP cephalograms in clinical settings. Methods : AP and PA cephalograms were generated from CBCT scans obtained from 25 adults. Four experienced and four inexperienced examiners were selected depending on their experience levels in analyzing frontal cephalograms. They identified six cephalometric landmarks on AP and PA cephalograms. The errors incurred in positioning the cephalometric landmarks on the AP and PA cephalograms were calculated by using the straight-line distance and the horizontal and vertical components as parameters. Results : Comparison of the landmark identification errors in CBCT-generated frontal cephalograms revealed that landmark-dependent differences were greater than experience- or projection-dependent differences. Comparisons of landmark identification errors in the horizontal and vertical directions revealed larger errors in identification of the crista galli and anterior nasal spine in the vertical direction and the menton in the horizontal direction , in comparison with the other landmarks. Comparison of landmark identification errors between the AP and PA projections in CBCT-generated images revealed a slightly higher error rate in the AP projections , with no inter-examiner differences. Statistical testing of the differences in landmark identification errors between AP and PA cephalograms showed no statistically significant differences for all landmarks. Conclusions : The reproducibility of CBCT-generated AP cephalograms is comparable to that of PA cephalograms ; therefore , AP cephalograms can be generated reliably from CBCT scan data in clinical settings . Patients with obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) whose phenotype belongs to a craniofacial vulnerability are referred from sleep doctors to orthodontists. In adults , for osseo-pharyngeal reconstruction ( OPR ) treatment , permanent maxillomandibular advancement ( MMA ) surgery and use of a temporary mandibular advancement device ( MAD ) are applied. This case report demonstrates successful treatment of OSA through application of phased MAD and MMA in a 16-year-old male with craniofacial deformity and residual growth potential. This patient showed skeletal and dentoalveolar changes after 7-year MAD use throughout post-adolescence , which affected the design and timing of subsequent MMA surgery , as well as post-surgical orthodontic strategy. This case report suggests that OPR treatment can be useful for treatment of OSA in post-adolescent patients , from an orthodontic point of view , in close collaboration with sleep doctors for interdisciplinary diagnosis and treatment . Objective : To compare the transverse dental changes induced by the palatally applied Frog appliance and buccally applied Karad 's integrated distalizing system ( KIDS ) . Methods : We evaluated the pre- and post distalization orthodontic models of 39 patients , including 19 treated using the Frog appliance , which is palatally positioned ( Frog group ) , and 20 treated using KIDS , which is buccally positioned ( KIDS group ) . Changes in intermolar and interpremolar distances and the amount of maxillary premolar and molar rotation were evaluated on model photocopies. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U tests were used for statistical evaluations. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results : Significant distopalatal rotation of premolars and distobuccal rotation of molars were observed in Frog group ( p < 0.05 ) , while significant distopalatal rotation of molars ( p < 0.05 ) , with no significant changes in premolars , was observed in KIDS group. The amount of second premolar and first molar rotation was significantly different between the two groups ( p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 , respectively ) . Furthermore , expansion in the region of the first molars and second premolars was significantly greater in KIDS group than in Frog group ( p < 0.001 for both ) . Conclusions : Our results suggest that the type and amount of first molar rotation and expansion vary with the design of the distalization appliance used . Objective : Root mobility due to reciprocating movement of the tooth ( jiggling ) may exacerbate orthodontic root resorption ( ORR ) . `` Jiggling '' describes mesiodistal or buccolingual movement of the roots of the teeth during orthodontic treatment. In the present study , buccolingual movement is described as `` jiggling. '' We aimed to investigate the relationship between ORR and jiggling and to test for positive cell expression in odontoclasts in resorbed roots during experimental tooth movement ( jiggling ) in vivo. Methods : Male Wistar rats were divided into control , heavy force ( HF ) , optimal force ( OF ) , and jiggling force ( JF ) groups. The expression levels of cathepsin K , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 protein , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant 1 ( CINC-1 ; an IL-8-related protein in rodents ) , receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand ( RANKL ) , and osteoprotegerin protein in the dental root were determined using immunohistochemistry. Results : On day 21 , a greater number of root resorption lacunae , which contained multinucleated odontoclasts , were observed in the palatal roots of rats in the JF group than in rats from other groups. Furthermore , there was a significant increase in the numbers of cathepsin K-positive and MMP-9-positive odontoclasts in the JF group on day 21. Immunoreactivities for IL-6 , CINC-1 , and RANKL were stronger in resorbed roots exposed to jiggling than in the other groups on day 21. Negative reactivity was observed in the controls. Conclusions : These results suggest that jiggling may induce ORR via inflammatory cytokine production during orthodontic tooth movement , and that jiggling may be a risk factor for ORR . Objective : A recently developed facial scanning method uses three-dimensional ( 3D ) surface imaging with a light-emitting diode. Such scanning enables surface data to be captured in high-resolution color and at relatively fast speeds. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and precision of 3D images obtained using the Morpheus 3D® scanner ( Morpheus Co. , Seoul , Korea ) . Methods : The sample comprised 30 subjects aged 24-34 years ( mean 29.0 ± 2.5 years ) . To test the correlation between direct and 3D image measurements , 21 landmarks were labeled on the face of each subject. Sixteen direct measurements were obtained twice using digital calipers ; the same measurements were then made on two sets of 3D facial images. The mean values of measurements obtained from both methods were compared. To investigate the precision , a comparison was made between two sets of measurements taken with each method. Results : When comparing the variables from both methods , five of the 16 possible anthropometric variables were found to be significantly different. However , in 12 of the 16 cases , the mean difference was under 1 mm. The average value of the differences for all variables was 0.75 mm. Precision was high in both methods , with error magnitudes under 0.5 mm. Conclusions:3D scanning images have high levels of precision and fairly good congruence with traditional anthropometry methods , with mean differences of less than 1 mm. 3D surface imaging using the Morpheus 3D® scanner is therefore a clinically acceptable method of recording facial integumental data . Objective : The aim of this study was to examine the properties of fiber-reinforced composite and stainless steel twisted retainers for orthodontic retention. Methods : Three different span lengths ( 5.0 , 8.0 , and 14.0 mm ) of fiber-reinforced composite were investigated. The three fiber-reinforced composite retainer groups were subdivided according to the storage condition ( dry and wet ) , resulting in a total of six groups. Each stainless steel and fiber-reinforced composite group was comprised of six specimens. The three-point bending flexural test was conducted using a universal testing machine. ANOVA was used to assess differences in the maximum load and maximum stress according to the span length , material , and storage condition.Post-hoccomparisons were performed if necessary. Results : The maximum stress and maximum load were significantly ( p < 0.001 ) associated with the span length , material , and storage condition. The significant interaction between the material and span length ( p < 0.001 ) indicated the differential effects of the material for each span length on the maximum stress and maximum load , with the difference between materials being the highest for the maximum span length. Conclusions : Our findings suggest that fiber-reinforced composite retainers may be an effective alternative for orthodontic retention in patients with esthetic concerns or allergy to conventional stainless steel wires . Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of measurements obtained after the superimposition of three-dimensional ( 3D ) digital models by comparing them with those obtained from lateral cephalometric radiographs and photocopies of plaster models for the evaluation of upper molar distalization. Methods : Data were collected from plaster models and lateral cephalometric radiographs of 20 Class II patients whose maxillary first molars were distalized with an intraoral distalizer. The posterior movements of the maxillary first molars were evaluated using lateral cephalometric radiographs ( group CP ) , photocopies of plaster models ( group PH ) , and digitized 3D models ( group TD ) . Additionally , distalization and expansion of the other teeth and the degrees of molar rotation were measured in group PH and group TD and compared between the two groups. Results : No significant difference was observed regarding the amount of molar distalization among the three groups. A comparison of the aforementioned parameters between group PH and group TD did not reveal any significant difference. Conclusions:3D digital models are reliable to assess the results of upper molar distalization and can be considered a valid alternative to conventional measurement methods . Objective : To evaluate differences in skeletal maturity in relation to vertical facial types and to compare differences in the skeletal maturity of the cervical vertebrae and hand-wrist in females. Methods : This study included 59 females aged 7 to 9 years with skeletal Class I malocclusion. The participants were categorized into three groups ( low , normal , and high ) according to the mandibular plane angle. Skeletal maturity was measured using skeletal maturity indicators ( SMIs ) and the Tanner-Whitehouse III ( TW3 ) method on hand-wrist radiographs and by using cervical vertebrae maturation indicators ( CVMIs ) on lateral cephalometric radiographs. Results : The SMI was higher in the high-angle group than in the low-angle group ( p= 0.014 ) . The median TW3 bone age was 11.4 months higher in the high-angle group than in the low-angle group ( p= 0.032 ) . There was no significant difference in CVMI among the three groups. Skeletal maturity showed a weakly positive correlation with the mandibular plane angle ( SMI , r= 0.391 ; TW3 , r= 0.333 ; CVMI , r= 0.259 ) . Conclusions : The skeletal maturity of the hand-wrist in females with a high mandibular plane angle was higher than that in females with a low mandibular plane angle. Obtaining additional hand-wrist radiographs may facilitate evaluation of skeletal maturity of females. In females with a high mandibular angle , the time to commence orthodontic treatment may be earlier than that in females with a low mandibular angle . Objective : To investigate the three-dimensional lip vermilion changes after extraction and non-extraction orthodontic treatment in female adult patients and explore the correlation between lip vermilion changes and incisor changes. Methods : Forty-seven young female adult patients were enrolled in this study ( skeletal Class III patients were excluded ) , including 34 lip-protruding patients treated by extraction of four first premolars ( 18 patients requiring mini-implants for maximum anchorage control and 16 patients without mini-implants ) and 13 patients requiring non-extraction treatment. Nine angles , seven distances , and the surface area of the lip vermilion were measured by using pre- and post-treatment three-dimensional facial scans. Linear and angular measurements of incisors were performed on lateral cephalograms. Results : There were no significant changes in the vermilion measurements in the non-extraction group. The vermilion angle , vermilion height , central bow angle , height/width ratio , and vermilion surface area decreased significantly after the orthodontic treatment in the extraction groups , but the upper/lower vermilion proportion remained unchanged. Significant correlations were found between the changes in incisor position and those in vermilion angles , vermilion height , and surface area. Conclusions : Extraction of the four first premolars probably produced an aesthetic improvement in lip vermilion morphology. However , the upper/lower vermilion proportion remained unchanged. The variations in the vermilion were closely related to incisor changes , especially the upper incisor inclination changes . When a patient shows severe crowding , premolar extraction should be considered to provide required available space for alignment. If the third molars have already erupted and demonstrate a poor prognosis , third molar extraction and distalization of the posterior dentition can be used instead of premolar extraction to obtain space. Interproximal stripping ( IPS ) may also be used to gain space in cases of crowding. This case report describes the treatment of a 25-year-old man with severe crowding and mild lip protrusion. Although the crowding in the lower arch was severe enough to require first premolar extraction , distalization of the entire lower dentition with orthodontic mini-implants , extraction of the lower third molars , and IPS could successfully resolve the crowding and lip protrusion . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the surface roughness ( SR ) of 2 types of orthodontic archwires made by 4 different manufacturers. Methods : This in vitro experimental study was conducted on 35 specimens of 7 different orthodontic archwires , namely , 1 nickel-titanium ( NiTi ) archwire each from the manufacturers American Orthodontics , OrthoTechnology , All-Star Orthodontics , and Smart Technology , and 1 stainless steel ( SS ) archwire each from the manufacturers American Orthodontics , OrthoTechnology , and All-Star Orthodontics. After analyzing the composition of each wire by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis , the SR of each wire was determined by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and surface profilometry. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests ( α < 0.05 ) . Results : The average SR of NiTi wires manufactured by Smart Technology , American Orthodontics , OrthoTechnology , and All-Star Orthodontics were 1,289 ± 915 A° , 1,378 ± 372 A° , 2,444 ± 369 A° , and 5,242 ± 2,832 A° , respectively. The average SR of SS wires manufactured by All-Star Orthodontics , OrthoTechnology , and American Orthodontics were 710 ± 210 A° , 1,831 ± 1,156 A° , and 4,018 ± 2,214 A° , respectively. Similar to the results of profilometry , the SEM images showed more defects and cracks on the SS wire made by American Orthodontics and the NiTi wire made by All-Star Orthodontics than others. Conclusions : The NiTi wire manufactured by All-Star Orthodontics and the SS wire made by American Orthodontics were the roughest wires . Objective : This study was conducted to perform histomorphometric evaluations of the bone surrounding orthodontic miniscrews according to their proximity to the adjacent tooth roots in the posterior mandible of beagle dogs. Methods : Four male beagle dogs were used for this study. Six orthodontic miniscrews were placed in the interradicular spaces in the posterior mandible of each dog ( n = 24 ) . The implanted miniscrews were classified into no loading , immediate loading , and delayed loading groups according to the loading time. At 6 weeks after screw placement , the animals were sacrificed , and tissue blocks including the miniscrews were harvested for histological examinations. After analysis of the histological sections , the miniscrews were categorized into three additional groups according to the root proximity : high root proximity , low root proximity , and safe distance groups. Differences in the bone-implant contact ( BIC , % ) among the root proximity groups and loading time groups were determined using statistical analyses. Results : No BIC was observed within the bundle bone invaded by the miniscrew threads. Narrowing of the periodontal ligament space was observed in cases where the miniscrew threads touched the bundle bone. BIC ( % ) was significantly lower in the high root proximity group than in the low root proximity and safe distance groups. However , BIC ( % ) showed no significant differences among the loading time groups. Conclusions : Regardless of the loading time , the stability of an orthodontic miniscrew is decreased if it is in contact with the bundle bone as well as the adjacent tooth root . Objective : The primary aim of the study was to generate new prediction equations for the estimation of maxillary and mandibular canine and premolar widths based on mandibular incisors and first permanent molar widths. Methods : A total of 2,340 calculations ( 768 based on the sum of mandibular incisor and first permanent molar widths , and 1,572 based on the maxillary and mandibular canine and premolar widths ) were performed , and a digital stereomicroscope was used to derive the the digital models and measurements. Mesiodistal widths of maxillary and mandibular teeth were measured via scanned digital models. Results : There was a strong positive correlation between the estimation of maxillary ( r = 0.85994 , r ( 2 ) = 0.7395 ) and mandibular ( r = 0.8708 , r ( 2 ) = 0.7582 ) canine and premolar widths. The intraclass correlation coefficients were statistically significant , and the coefficients were in the strong correlation range , with an average of 0.9. Linear regression analysis was used to establish prediction equations. Prediction equations were developed to estimate maxillary arches based on Y = 15.746 + 0.602 _ sum of mandibular incisors and mandibular first permanent molar widths ( sum of mandibular incisors [ SMI ] + molars ) , Y = 18.224 + 0.540 _ ( SMI + molars ) , and Y = 16.186 + 0.586 _ ( SMI + molars ) for both genders , and to estimate mandibular arches the parameters used were Y = 16.391 + 0.564 _ ( SMI + molars ) , Y = 14.444 + 0.609 _ ( SMI + molars ) , and Y = 19.915 + 0.481 _ ( SMI + molars ) . Conclusions : These formulas will be helpful for orthodontic diagnosis and clinical treatment planning during the mixed dentition stage . Objective : This study aimed to ( 1 ) evaluate the effects of maxillary second and third molar eruption status on the distalization of first molars with a modified palatal anchorage plate ( MPAP ) , and ( 2 ) compare the results to the outcomes of the use of a pendulum and that of a headgear using three-dimensional finite element analysis. Methods : Three eruption stages were established : an erupting second molar at the cervical one-third of the first molar root ( Stage 1 ) , a fully erupted second molar ( Stage 2 ) , and an erupting third molar at the cervical one-third of the second molar root ( Stage 3 ) . Retraction forces were applied via three anchorage appliance models : an MPAP with bracket and archwire , a bone-anchored pendulum appliance , and cervical-pull headgear. Results : An MPAP showed greater root movement of the first molar than crown movement , and this was more noticeable in Stages 2 and 3. With the other devices , the first molar showed distal tipping. Transversely , the first molar had mesial-out rotation with headgear and mesial-in rotation with the other devices. Vertically , the first molar was intruded with an MPAP , and extruded with the other appliances. Conclusions : The second molar eruption stage had an effect on molar distalization , but the third molar follicle had no effect. The application of an MPAP may be an effective treatment option for maxillary molar distalization . Objective : The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence and distribution of ectopic eruption of the permanent maxillary first molar ( EEM ) in individuals scheduled for orthodontic treatment and to investigate the association of EEM with dental characteristics , maxillary skeletal features , crowding , and other dental anomalies. Methods : A total of 1,317 individuals were included and randomly divided into two groups. The first 265 subjects were included as controls , while the remaining 1,052 subjects included the sample from which the final experimental EEM group was derived. The mesiodistal ( M-D ) crown width of the deciduous maxillary second molar and permanent maxillary first molar , maxillary arch length ( A-PML ) , maxillomandibular transverse skeletal relationships ( anterior and posterior transverse interarch discrepancies , ATID and PTID ) , maxillary and mandibular tooth crowding , and the presence of dental anomalies were recorded for each subject , and the statistical significance of differences in these parameters between the EEM and control groups was determined using independent sample t-tests. Chi-square tests were used to compare the prevalence of other dental anomalies between the two groups. Results : The prevalence of maxillary EEM was 2.5 % . The M-D crown widths , ATID and PTID , and tooth crowding were significantly greater , while A-PML was significantly smaller , in the EEM group than in the control group. Only two subjects showed an association between EEM and maxillary lateral incisor anomalies , which included agenesis in one and microdontia in the other. Conclusions : EEM may be a risk factor for maxillary arch constriction and severe tooth crowding . Objective : The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy and reliability of measurements performed using two different software programs on digital models generated using two types of plaster model scanners ( a laser scanner and a computed tomography [ CT ] scanner ) . Methods : Thirty plaster models were scanned with a 3Shape laser scanner and with a Flash CT scanner. Two examiners performed measurements on plaster models by using digital calipers and on digital models by using Ortho Analyzer ( 3Shape ) and Digimodel® ( OrthoProof ) software programs. Forty-two measurements , including tooth diameter , crown height , overjet , overbite , intercanine and intermolar distances , and sagittal relationship , were obtained. Results : Statistically significant differences were not found between the plaster and digital model measurements ( ANOVA ) ; however , some discrepancies were clinically relevant. Plaster and digital model measurements made using the two scanning methods showed high intraclass coefficient correlation values and acceptable 95 % limits of agreement in the Bland-Altman analysis. The software used did not influence the accuracy of measurements. Conclusions : Digital models generated from plaster casts by using laser and CT scanning and measured using two different software programs are accurate , and the measurements are reliable. Therefore , both fabrication methods and software could be used interchangeably . Objective : The aim of this study was to compare posterior tooth inclinations , occlusal force , and contact area of adults with different sagittal malocclusions. Methods : Transverse skeletal parameters and posterior tooth inclinations were evaluated using cone beam computed tomography images , and occlusal force as well as contact area were assessed using pressure-sensitive films in 124 normodivergent adults. A linear mixed model was used to cluster posterior teeth into maxillary premolar , maxillary molar , mandibular premolar , and mandibular molar groups. Differences among Class I , II , and III groups were compared using an analysis of variance test and least significant differencepost-hoctest. Correlations of posterior dental inclinations to occlusal function were analyzed using Pearson 's correlation analysis. Results : In male subjects , maxillary premolars and molars had the smallest inclinations in the Class II group while maxillary molars had the greatest inclinations in the Class III group. In female subjects , maxillary molars had the smallest inclinations in the Class II group , while maxillary premolars and molars had the greatest inclinations in the Class III group. Occlusal force and contact area were not significantly different among Class I , II , and III groups. Conclusions : Premolar and molar inclinations showed compensatory inclinations to overcome anteroposterior skeletal discrepancy in the Class II and III groups ; however , their occlusal force and contact area were similar to those of Class I group. In subjects with normodivergent facial patterns , although posterior tooth inclinations may vary , difference in occlusal function may be clinically insignificant in adults with Class I , II , and III malocclusions . Orthodontic treatment of posterior bite collapse due to early loss of molars and the consequent drift of adjacent teeth is complicated. When the posterior bite collapse occurs in patients with facial asymmetry , both transverse and vertical compensation are necessary for camouflage orthodontic treatment. In such cases , posterior maxillary segmental osteotomy ( PMSO ) can be an effective alternative procedure that simplifies the orthodontic treatment and shows long-term stability through dental compensation within the alveolar bone housing. This case report aimed to describe the orthodontic treatment of maxillary occlusal plane canting caused by severely extruded maxillary teeth in a patient with skeletal facial asymmetry that was corrected with PMSO along with protraction of the lower second molar to replace the space of the extracted first molar. The treatment duration was 18 months , and stable results were obtained after 2 years of retention . Clear thermoplastic retainers have been widely used in daily orthodontics ; however , they have inherent limitations associated with thermoplastic polymer materials such as dimensional instability , low strength , and poor wear resistance. To solve these problems , we developed a new type of clear orthodontic retainer that incorporates multi-layer hybrid materials. It consists of three layers ; an outer polyethylenterephthalate glycol modified ( PETG ) hard-type polymer , a middle thermoplastic polyurethane ( TPU ) soft-type polymer , and an inner reinforced resin core. The resin core improves wear resistance and mechanical strength , which prevent unwanted distortion of the bucco-palatal wall of the retainer. The TPU layer absorbs impact and the PETG layer has good formability , optical qualities , fatigue resistance , and dimensional stability , which contributes to increased support from the mandibular dentition , and helps maintain the archform. This new type of vacuum-formed retainer showed improved mechanical strength and rate of water absorption . Objective : Rapid maxillary expansion ( RME ) is used to expand the maxilla and increase arch perimeter ; yet , there are few reports on its effects on the sphenoid bone. With cone-beam computed topography ( CBCT ) , it is possible to visualize sphenoid bone changes. The purpose of this study was to investigate sphenoid bone changes observed in conjunction with RME treatments , using CBCT. Methods : Sixty patients ( 34 women and 26 men , aged 11-17 years ) underwent RME as part of their orthodontic treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups : a tooth-anchored group , a bone-anchored group , or a control group. Initial CBCT scans were performed preceding the RME treatment ( T1 ) and again directly after the completion of expansion ( T2 ) . Statistical analysis included ANOVA , descriptive statistics , and the intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) . Results : The reliability of the landmark location was at least 0.783 , and the largest ICC mean measurement error was 2.32 mm. With regard to distances , the largest change was 0.78 mm , which was not statistically significant ( p > 0.05 ) . Statistical significance was established in patient groups of the same sex and treatment type for the following distance measurements : right anterior lateral pterygoid plate to the right edge of the hypophyseal fossa ( d2 ) , anterior distance between the medial pterygoid plates ( d4 ) , and anterior distance between the left medial and lateral plates ( d8 ) . Conclusions : In this study , there were no clinically significant changes in the sphenoid bone due to RME treatments regardless of sex or treatment type . Objective : To evaluate the short-term changes in masticatory muscle activity and mandibular movement patterns after orthognathic surgery in skeletal Class III patients with facial asymmetry. Methods : Twenty-seven skeletal Class III adult patients were divided into two groups based on the degree of facial asymmetry : the experimental group ( n = 17 [ 11 male and 6 female ] ; menton deviation 4 mm ) and control group ( n = 10 [ 4 male and 6 female ] ; menton deviation < 1.6 mm ) . Cephalography , electromyography ( EMG ) for the anterior temporalis ( TA ) and masseter muscles ( MM ) , and mandibular movement ( range of motion [ ROM ] and average chewing pattern [ ACP ] ) were evaluated before ( T0 ) and 7 to 8 months ( T1 ) after the surgery. Results : There were no significant postoperative changes in the EMG potentials of the TA and MM in both groups , except in the anterior cotton roll biting test , in which the masticatory muscle activity had changed into an MM-dominant pattern postoperatively in both groups. In the experimental group , the amount of maximum opening , protrusion , and lateral excursion to the non-deviated side were significantly decreased. The turning point tended to be shorter and significantly moved medially during chewing in the non-deviated side in the experimental group. Conclusions : In skeletal Class III patients with facial asymmetry , the EMG activity characteristics recovered to presurgical levels within 7 to 8 months after the surgery. Correction of the asymmetry caused limitation in jaw movement in terms of both ROM and ACP on the non-deviated side . Assessing the condition of the alveolar bone before and after orthodontic treatment is important. Recently , cone-beam computed tomography has been widely accepted as a useful tool for orthodontic treatment. Moreover , using a three-dimensional ( 3D ) structural analysis software enables gathering detailed information and quantifying data. The aim of this study was to introduce various quantitative analyses performed before and after orthodontic treatment by using a 3D structural analysis software for evaluating the morphological condition of the alveolar bone of a patient with gingival recession around the canines . Objective : The purpose of this study was to determine whether predicting maturation of the midpalatal suture is possible by classifying its morphology on cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images and to investigate relationships with other developmental age indices. Methods : The morphology of the midpalatal suture was assessed by using CBCT images of 99 patients. Axial plane images of the midpalatal suture were classified into five stages according to the classification scheme. To make the assessment more accurate , the morphology and fusion of the midpalatal suture were additionally investigated on coronal cross-sectional planar images and volume-rendered images. Bone age was evaluated using the hand and wrist method ( HWM ) and cervical vertebrae method ( CVM ) ; dental age ( Hellman 's index ) , sex , and chronological age were also assessed. To evaluate relationships among variables , Spearman 's rho rank test was performed along with crosstabs using contingency coefficients. Results : The HWM and CVM showed strong correlations with the maturation stage of the midpalatal suture , while other indices showed relatively weak correlations ( p < 0.01 ) . Through crosstabs , the HWM and CVM showed high association values with CBCT stage ; the HWM demonstrated slightly higher values ( p < 0.0001 ) . Based on the HWM , the midpalatal suture was not fused until stage 6 in both sexes. Conclusions : Among developmental age indices , the HWM and CVM showed strong correlations and high associations , suggesting that they can be useful in assessing maturation of the midpalatal suture . Objective : The aims of our study were to verify the validity of the T-Scan III system ( Tekscan ) as an objective occlusal evaluation tool , and to assess the differences between two occlusal indexes-the peer assessment rating ( PAR ) index and the American Board of Orthodontics objective grading system ( OGS ) -by comparing the scores derived from the T-Scan III system with the two occlusal indexes and analyzing the correlations between them. Methods : The final study sample included 48 adult volunteers ( 39 men and 9 women , mean age 24.14 ± 3.16 years ) , after excluding 29 volunteers whose occlusion could not be evaluated by the T-Scan III system due to severe skeletal or occlusal problems. PAR index and OGS scores were assessed using dental study models , and measurements of centric occlusion , protrusive movement , and lateral excursion movement were obtained via the T-Scan III system. The results were analyzed to determine correlations. Results : Occlusal analysis by the T-Scan III system was clinically reliable ( p < 0.05 ) , and the PAR index and OGS scores were significantly correlated with several measurements obtained with the T-Scan III system ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : The T-Scan III system is a quantitative and reliable method for occlusal evaluation , and represents a potential substitute for occlusal indexes. Compared to the PAR index , the OGS scores of more variables were significantly correlated with the T-Scan measurements . Objective : The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate short-term and long-term skeletodental outcomes of Class III activator treatment. Methods : A Class III activator treatment group ( AG ) comprised of 22 patients ( 9 boys , 13 girls ) was compared with a Class III control group ( CG ) comprised of 17 patients ( 6 boys , 11 girls ) . The total treatment period was divided into three stages ; the initial stage ( T1 ) , the post-activator treatment or post-mandibular growth peak stage ( T2 ) , and the long-term follow-up stage ( T3 ) . Cephalometric changes were evaluated statistically via the Mann-Whitney U-test and the Friedman test. Results : The AG exhibited significant increases in the SNA angle , ANB angle , Wits appraisal , A point-N perpendicular , Convexity of A point , and proclination of the maxillary incisors , from T1 to T2. In the long-term follow-up ( T1-T3 ) , the AG exhibited significantly greater increases in the ANB angle , Wits appraisal , and Convexity of A point than the CG. Conclusions : Favorable skeletal outcomes induced during the Class III activator treatment period were generally maintained until the long-term follow-up period of the post-mandibular growth peak stage . Objective : The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of continuous force application for extrusive tipping movement and occlusal interference on periapical root resorption in the rat mandibular first molar. Methods : We constructed an appliance comprising a titanium screw implant with a cobalt-chromium post as the anchorage unit and a nickel-titanium closed coil spring ( 50 cN ) as the active unit. Force was applied on the mandibular left first molar of rats for 8 ( n = 10 ) and 15 days ( n = 10 ; experimental groups ) , with the tooth in occlusion. Five rats were included as a non-treated control group to examine the body effect of the appliance. Active root resorption lacunae , identified using tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase , were evaluated in terms of the length , depth , and area. Results : The rat mandibular first molars were mesially tipped and extruded in the occlusal direction. This mesio-occlusal tipping movement and occlusion resulted in the formation of a compression zone and active root resorption lacunae in the distoapical third of the distal roots. However , there was no significant difference in the amount of root resorption between the two experimental groups. The control group did not exhibit any active root resorption lacunae. Conclusions : Periapical root resorption was induced by continuous extrusive tipping force and occlusal interference in rat mandibular molars. These data suggest that we orthodontists had better take care not to induce occlusal interference during our orthodontic treatment . Objective : The aim of this study was to compare the shear bond strength ( SBS ) of orthodontic brackets bonded to zirconia surfaces using three different zirconia primers and one silane primer , and subjected to thermocycling. Methods : We designed 10 experimental groups following the surface treatment and thermocycling. The surface was treated with one of the following method : no-primer ( NP ) , Porcelain Conditioner ( PC ) , Z-PRIME Plus ( ZP ) , Monobond Plus ( MP ) and Zirconia Liner Premium ( ZL ) ( n=20 ) . Then each group was subdivided to non-thermocycled and thermocycled groups ( NPT , PC , ZPT , MPT , ZLT ) ( n=10 ) . Orthodontic brackets were bonded to the specimens using Transbond XT Paste and light cured for 15 s at 1,100 mW/cm ( 2 ) . The SBS was measured at a 1 mm/min crosshead speed. The failure mode was assessed by examination with a stereomicroscope and the amount of bonding resin remaining on the zirconia surface was scored using the modified adhesive remnant index ( ARI ) . Results : The SBS of all experimental groups decreased after thermocycling. Before thermocycling , the SBS was ZL , ZP MP PC > NP but after thermocycling , the SBS was ZLT MPT ZPT > PCT = NPT ( p > 0.05 ) . For the ARI score , both of the groups lacking primer ( NP and NPT ) displayed adhesive failure modes , but the groups with zirconia primers ( ZP , ZPT , MP , MPT , ZL , and ZLT ) were associated with mixed failure modes. Conclusions : Surface treatment with a zirconia primer increases the SBS relative to no-primer or silane primer application between orthodontic brackets and zirconia prostheses . Objective : To date , only a few studies have investigated the relationships between genetic polymorphisms and external apical root resorption ( EARR ) . Hence , the aim of this systematic review was to explore the relationship between different gene polymorphisms and their association with EARR. Methods : A complete literature search was conducted by two independent reviewers. The PubMed , Science Direct , and Scopus databases were searched. In addition , the bibliographies of all textbooks and relevant articles were searched manually. A meta-analysis was performed using data entered into the electronic databases until February 28 , 2017. Results : On the basis of the search , we identified 17 and 7 publications for the systematic review and meta-analysis , respectively. Odds ratio ( OR ) was used to evaluate the association of the interleukin 1B ( +3954 ) polymorphism and the risk of EARR. The overall OR from the studies was used to estimate the risk of EARR. However , no association was found and no publication bias was apparent for the risk of EARR in patients receiving orthodontic treatment. Conclusions : More research on the relationship between gene polymorphism and EARR is necessary to determine better specificity of possible interactions . Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate the skeletal and dental changes after intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy ( IVRO ) with and without presurgical orthodontics by using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) . Methods : This retrospective cohort study included 24 patients ( mean age , 22.1 years ) with skeletal Class III malocclusion who underwent bimaxillary surgery with IVRO. The patients were divided into the preorthodontic orthognathic surgery ( POGS ) group ( n = 12 ) and conventional surgery ( CS ) group ( n = 12 ) . CBCT images acquired preoperatively , 1 month after surgery , and 1 year after surgery were analyzed to compare the intergroup differences in postoperative three-dimensional movements of the maxillary and mandibular landmarks and the changes in lateral cephalometric variables. Results : Baseline demographics ( sex and age ) were similar between the two groups ( 6 men and 6 women in each group ) . During the postsurgical period , the POGS group showed more significant upward movement of the mandible ( p < 0.05 ) than did the CS group. Neither group showed significant transverse movement of any of the skeletal landmarks. Moreover , none of the dental and skeletal variables showed significant intergroup differences 1 year after surgery. Conclusions : Compared with CS , POGS with IVRO resulted in significantly different postsurgical skeletal movement in the mandible. Although both groups showed similar skeletal and dental outcomes at 1 year after surgery , upward movement of the mandible during the postsurgical period should be considered to ensure a more reliable outcome after POGS . Objective : To measure aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) activity in the pulp of teeth treated with fixed appliances for 6 months , and compare it with AST activity measured in untreated teeth. Methods : The study sample consisted of 16 healthy subjects ( mean age 25.7 ± 4.3 years ) who required the extraction of maxillary premolars for orthodontic reasons. Of these , 6 individuals had a total of 11 sound teeth extracted without any orthodontic treatment ( the control group ) , and 10 individuals had a total of 20 sound teeth extracted after 6 months of orthodontic alignment ( the experimental group ) . Dental pulp samples were extracted from all control and experimental teeth , and the AST activity exhibited by these samples was determined spectrophotometrically at 20. Results : Mean AST values were 25.29 _ 10 ( -5 ) U/mg ( standard deviation [ SD ] 9.95 ) in the control group and 27.54 _ 10 ( -5 ) U/mg ( SD 31.81 ) in the experimental group. The difference between these means was not statistically significantly ( p = 0.778 ) , and the distribution of the AST values was also similar in both groups. Conclusions : No statistically significant increase in AST activity in the pulp of mechanically loaded teeth was detected after 6 months of orthodontic alignment , as compared to that of teeth extracted from individuals who had not undergone orthodontic treatment. This suggests that time-related regenerative processes occur in the dental pulp . Objective : To investigate the dimensional accuracy of digital dental models obtained from the dental cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) scan of alginate impressions according to the time elapse when the impressions are stored under ambient conditions. Methods : Alginate impressions were obtained from 20 adults using 3 different alginate materials , 2 traditional alginate materials ( Alginoplast and Cavex Impressional ) and 1 extended-pour alginate material ( Cavex ColorChange ) . The impressions were stored under ambient conditions , and scanned by CBCT immediately after the impressions were taken , and then at 1 hour intervals for 6 hours. After reconstructing three-dimensional digital dental models , the models were measured and the data were analyzed to determine dimensional changes according to the elapsed time. The changes within the measurement error were regarded as clinically acceptable in this study. Results : All measurements showed a decreasing tendency with an increase in the elapsed time after the impressions. Although the extended-pour alginate exhibited a less decreasing tendency than the other 2 materials , there were no statistically significant differences between the materials. Changes above the measurement error occurred between the time points of 3 and 4 hours after the impressions. Conclusions : The results of this study indicate that digital dental models can be obtained simply from a CBCT scan of alginate impressions without sending them to a remote laboratory. However , when the impressions are not stored under special conditions , they should be scanned immediately , or at least within 2 to 3 hours after the impressions are taken . The aim of this clinical report is to describe the complex treatment of an adult Class III malocclusion patient who was disappointed with the outcome of a previous oral rehabilitation. Interdisciplinary treatment planning was performed with a primary indication for implant removal because of marginal bone loss and gingival recession , followed by orthodontic and surgical procedures to correct the esthetics and skeletal malocclusion. The comprehensive treatment approach included : ( 1 ) implant removal in the area of the central incisors ; ( 2 ) combined orthodontic decompensation with mesial displacement and forced extrusion of the lateral incisors ; ( 3 ) extraction of the lateral incisors and placement of new implants corresponding to the central incisors , which received provisional crowns ; ( 4 ) orthognathic surgery for maxillary advancement to improve occlusal and facial relationships ; and finally , ( 5 ) orthodontic refinement followed by definitive prosthetic rehabilitation of the maxillary central incisors and reshaping of the adjacent teeth. At the three-year follow-up , clinical and radiographic examinations showed successful replacement of the central incisors and improved skeletal and esthetic appearances. Moreover , a Class II molar relationship was obtained with an ideal overbite , overjet , and intercuspation. In conclusion , we report the successful esthetic anterior rehabilitation of a complex case in which interdisciplinary treatment planning improved facial harmony , provided gingival architecture with sufficient width and thickness , and improved smile esthetics , resulting in enhanced patient comfort and satisfaction. This clinical case report might be useful to improve facial esthetics and occlusion in patients with dentoalveolar and skeletal defects . Objective : This study examined bone microstructure restoration after rapid maxillary expansion ( RME ) with and without corticotomy over multiple retention periods. Methods : Eighteen male Dorper sheep were randomly distributed into three groups ( n = 6 each group ) : group 1 , RME with corticotomy on the buccal and palatal sides ; group 2 , conventional RME treatment ; and group 3 , no treatment. Post-RME , trabecular bone microstructure and new bone formation were evaluated by using microcomputed tomography ( microCT ) and histomorphometry after a 4- or 12-week retention period. Intergroup differences in bone quality and bone remodeling were analyzed by using two-way analysis of variance with Bonferronipost-hoctest. Results : The bone volume fraction ( bone volume [ BV ] /total volume [ TV ] ) values relative to the control in groups 1 and 2 were 54.40 % to 69.88 % after the 4-week retention period and returned to approximately 80 % after the 12-week retention period. The pooled BV/TV values of the banded teeth in groups 1 and 2 were significantly lower than those of the control after the 4-week retention period ( p < 0.05 ) . However , after the 12-week retention period , the pooled BV/TV values in group 2 were significantly lower than those in groups 1 and 3 ( p < 0.05 ) . Histomorphological analysis showed that the new bone formation area in group 1 was approximately two to three times of those in group 2 and control. Conclusions : Corticotomy significantly enhanced the restoration of bone quality after the retention periods for banded teeth. This benefit might result from the increased new bone formation after corticotomy . Objective : To evaluate the effects of facemask therapy , which was anchored from the zygomatic buttresses of the maxilla by using two miniplates , in skeletal Class III patients with maxillary deficiency. Methods : Eighteen skeletal Class III patients ( 10 girls and 8 boys ; mean age , 11.4 ± 1.28 years ) with maxillary deficiency were treated using miniplate-anchored facemasks , and their outcomes were compared with those of a Class III control group ( 9 girls and 9 boys ; mean age , 10.6 ± 1.12 years ) . Two I-shaped miniplates were placed on the right and left zygomatic buttresses of the maxilla , and a facemask was applied with a 400 g force per side. Intragroup comparisons were made using the Wilcoxon test , and intergroup comparisons were made using the Mann-WhitneyU-test ( p < 0.05 ) . Results : In the treatment group , the maxilla moved 3.3 mm forward , the mandible showed posterior rotation by 1.5° , and the lower incisors were retroclined after treatment. These results were significantly different from those in the control group ( p < 0.05 ) . No significant anterior rotation of the palatal plane was observed after treatment. Moreover , changes in the sagittal positions of the maxillary incisors and molars were similar between the treatment and control groups. Conclusions : Skeletally anchored facemask therapy is an effective method for correcting Class III malocclusions , which also minimizes the undesired dental side effects of conventional methods in the maxilla . Objective : The purpose of this study was to compare the changes induced in the pharyngeal airway space by orthodontic treatment with bodily retraction of the mandibular incisors and mandibular setback surgery without extraction. Methods : This retrospective study included 63 adult patients ( 32 men and 31 women ) . Thirty-three patients who had been treated via four-bicuspid extraction and bodily retraction of the mandibular incisors ( incisor retraction , IR group ) were compared with 30 patients who had been treated via mandibular setback surgery ( MS group ) without extraction. Lateral cephalograms were acquired and analyzed before ( T1 ) and after treatment ( T2 ) . Results : The superior pharyngeal airway space did not change significantly in either group during treatment. The middle pharyngeal airway space decreased by 1.15 ± 1.17 mm and 1.25 ± 1.35 mm after treatment in the IR and MS groups , respectively , and the decrease was comparable between the two groups. In the MS group , the inferior pharyngeal airway space ( E-IPW ) decreased by 0.88 ± 1.67 mm after treatment ( p < 0.01 ) . The E-IPW was larger in the MS group than in IR group at T1 , but it did not differ significantly between the two groups at T2. No significant correlation was observed between changes in the pharyngeal airway space and the skeletal and dental variables in each group. Conclusions : The middle pharyngeal airway space decreased because of the posterior displacement of the mandibular incisors and/or the mandibular body. The E-IPW decreased only in the MS group because of the posterior displacement of only the mandibular body . Objective : The aim of this study was to investigate whether labial tooth inclination and alveolar bone loss affect the moment per unit of force ( Mt/F ) in controlled tipping and consequent stresses on the periodontal ligament ( PDL ) . Methods : Three-dimensional models ( n = 20 ) of maxillary central incisors were created with different labial inclinations ( 5° , 10° , 15° , and 20° ) and different amounts of alveolar bone loss ( 0 , 2 , 4 , and 6 mm ) . The Mt/F necessary for controlled tipping ( Mt/Fcont ) and the principal stresses on the PDL were calculated for each model separately in a finite element analysis. Results : As labial inclination increased , Mt/Fcont and the length of the moment arm decreased. In contrast , increased alveolar bone loss caused increases in Mt/Fcont and the length of the moment arm. When Mt/F was near Mt/Fcont , increases in Mt/F caused compressive stresses to move from a predominantly labial apical region to a palatal apical position , and tensile stresses in the labial area moved from a cervical position to a mid-root position. Although controlled tipping was applied to the incisors , increases in alveolar bone loss and labial tooth inclination caused increases in maximum compressive and tensile stresses at the root apices. Conclusions : Increases in alveolar bone loss and labial tooth inclination caused increases in stresses that might cause root resorption at the root apex , despite the application of controlled tipping to the incisors . Objective : To evaluate the changes in the nose in three dimensions after Le Fort I osteotomy in patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion. Methods : The subjects were 40 adult patients ( 20 females and 20 males ; mean age , 20.3 ± 3.0 years ; range , 17.0 to 31.1 years ) who underwent one-piece Le Fort I osteotomy with maxillary advancement and impaction treatment for maxillary hypoplasia. The mean maxillary advancement was 4.56 ± 1.34 mm , and the mean maxillary impaction was 2.03 ± 1.04 mm. Stereophotogrammetry was used to acquire three-dimensional images before and at least 6 months after surgery. Results : Alare ( Al ) and alare curvature ( Ac ) points had moved vertically and anterolaterally postoperatively. A significant increase was observed in the nasal ala width and alar base width , and no changes were noted in the columellar length , nasolabial angle , and nasal area. There was a significant relationship between maxillary impaction and nasal ala width and horizontal and sagittal positions of the bilateral Al and Ac. The only relationship found was between maxillary advancement and postoperative sagittal location of the subnasale and pronasale. Conclusions : Nasal soft tissues were highly affected by the vertical movement of the maxilla ; however , the soft tissue responses were individual-dependent . Objective : The additional arch length required for leveling ( AALL ) the curve of Spee ( COS ) can be estimated by subtracting the two-dimensional ( 2D ) arch circumference , which is the projection of the three-dimensional ( 3D ) arch circumference onto the occlusal plane , from the 3D arch circumference , which represents the arch length after leveling the COS. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the cusp tips or proximal maximum convexities are more appropriate reference points for estimating the AALL. Methods : Sixteen model setups of the mandibular arch with COS depths ranging from 0 mm to 4.7 mm were constructed using digital simulation. Arch circumferences in 2D and 3D were measured from the cusp tips and proximal maximum convexities and used to calculate the AALL. The values obtained using the two reference points were compared with the pairedt-test. Results : Although the 3D arch circumference should be constant regardless of the COS depth , it decreased by 3.8 mm in cusp tip measurements and by 0.4 mm in proximal maximum convexity measurements as the COS deepened to 4.7 mm. AALL values calculated using the cusp tips as reference points were significantly smaller than those calculated using the proximal maximum convexities ( p= 0.002 ) . Conclusions : The AALL is underestimated when the cusp tips are used as measurement reference points ; the AALL can be measured more accurately using the proximal maximum convexities . Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate the static ( SFF ) and kinetic frictional forces ( KFF ) in sliding mechanics of hybrid bracket systems that involve placing a conventional bracket ( CB ) or active self-ligating bracket ( ASLB ) on the maxillary anterior teeth ( MXAT ) and a passive SLB ( PSLB ) on the maxillary posterior teeth ( MXPT ) . Methods : The samples consisted of two thoroughbred types ( group 1 , anterior-CB + posterior-CB ; group 2 , anterior-ASLB + posterior-ASLB ) and four hybrid types ( group 3 , anterior-CB + posterior-PSLB-type 1 ; group 4 , anterior-CB + posterior-PSLB-type 2 ; group 5 , anterior-ASLB + posterior-PSLB-type 1 ; group 6 , anterior-ASLB + posterior-PSLB-type 2 ) ( n = 13 per group ) . After maxillary dentition alignment and maxillary first premolars removal in the stereolithographically-made typodont system , a 0.019 _ 0.025-inch stainless steel wire was drawn through the right quadrant of the maxillary arch at 0.5 mm/min for 5 min. The SFF and KFF were measured with a mechanical testing machine and statistical analyses were performed. Results : Four different categories of SFF and KFF were observed among all groups ( all p < 0.001 ) . Group 1 demonstrated the highest SFF and KFF ; groups 4 and 3 were second and third highest , respectively. The fourth category included groups 2 , 5 , and 6. Placing PSLBs on the MXPT resulted in significant SFF and KFF reductions in cases with CBs on the MXAT , but not in cases with ASLBs on the MXAT. Conclusions : These data might aid in the development of a hybrid bracket system that enables low-friction sliding of an archwire through the MXPT . Objective : The objectives of this study were to evaluate linear and volumetric alveolar changes induced by nasoalveolar molding ( NAM ) in infants with complete unilateral cleft lip and palate ( UCLP ) and compare the maxillary dimensions after NAM with the normal dimensions in infants without clefts. Methods : A total of 26 infants with UCLP treated by NAM ( mean age before and after NAM : 14.20 ± 8.09 days and 118.16 ± 10.06 days , respectively ) comprised the treatment group , while 26 infants without clefts ( mean age : 115.81 ± 8.71 days ) comprised the control group. Changes in the maxillary dimensions following NAM were measured on three-dimensional models using Mimics software , version 17.0. Results : During NAM , there was a decrease in the cleft widths , maxillary arch depths , and rotation of the greater segment. While the anterior alveolar arch width exhibited a significant decrease , the posterior arch width was mostly maintained. There were no changes in the anterior vertical deviations of the alveolar segments. The alveolar crest lengths , arch circumference , and bilateral posterior volumetric measures exhibited an increase. After NAM , the anterior arch width was comparable between the treatment and control groups , whereas the posterior arch width and anterior vertical deviations were greater in the treatment group than in the control group. The maxillary arch depths , alveolar crest lengths , and maxillary volumes were smaller in the NAM group than in the control group. Conclusions : During NAM in infants with UCLP , the cleft width and anteroposterior and transverse alveolar dimensions exhibited a decrease while the vertical dimensions were maintained. Compared with infants without clefts , those with UCLP treated by NAM exhibited sagittal and vertical alveolar growth deficiencies and tissue insufficiency . This case report describes the orthodontic treatment performed for open bite caused by internal derangement ( ID ) and osteoarthritis ( OA ) of the temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) . A Japanese woman , aged 31 years and 11 months , referred to our department by an oral surgeon had an open bite with clockwise rotation of the mandible and degeneration of the condyle. The overbite was corrected through intrusion of the maxillary and mandibular molars using mini-screw implants to induce counterclockwise rotation of the mandible. Then , the mandibular second premolars were extracted and comprehensive orthodontic treatment was performed to establish a Class I molar relationship with distalization of the maxillary arch and to eliminate anterior crowding. Following treatment , her facial profile improved and a functional and stable occlusion was achieved without recurrence of the TMJ symptoms. These results suggest that orthodontic intrusion of the molars is one of the safer and less stressful alternatives for the management of open bite due to degeneration of the condyles caused by ID and OA of TMJ . Objective : To evaluate the psychosocial impact of malocclusion , determine its relationship with the severity of malocclusion , and assess the influence of gender and social class on this relationship in adolescents. Methods : A random sample of 627 Spanish adolescents aged 12 - 15 years underwent intraoral examinations by 3 calibrated examiners ( intraexaminer and interexaminer kappa > 0.85 ) at their schools. Psychosocial impact was measured through a self-rated Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire ( PIDAQ ) . The severity of malocclusion was measured by the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need ( IOTN ) . Gender and social class were also recorded. Results : The total PIDAQ score and those of its 4 subscales , social impact , psychological impact , aesthetic concern , and dental self-confidence , presented significant differences ( p 0.05 by analysis of variance ) and linear relationships with the IOTN grades ( p 0.05 by linear regression ) . Stepwise linear regression models showed that the IOTN dental health component was a predictive variable of the total and subscale PIDAQ scores. Neither gender nor social class was an independent predictive variable of this relationship , except the linear model for psychological impact , where gender was a predictive variable. The occlusal conditions responsible for higher PIDAQ scores were increased overjet , impeded eruption , tooth displacement , and increased overbite. Conclusions : Malocclusion has a psychological impact in adolescents and this impact increases with the severity of malocclusion. Social class may not influence this association , but the psychological impact seems to be greater among girls . Objective : The aims of this study were to compare the shear bond strength between orthodontic metal brackets and glazed zirconia using different types of primer before applying resin cement and to determine which primer was more effective. Methods : Zirconia blocks were milled and embedded in acrylic resin and randomly assigned to one of four groups : nonglazed zirconia with sandblasting and zirconia primer ( NZ ) ; glazed zirconia with sandblasting , etching , and zirconia primer ( GZ ) ; glazed zirconia with sandblasting , etching , and porcelain primer ( GP ) ; and glazed zirconia with sandblasting , etching , zirconia primer , and porcelain primer ( GZP ) . A stainless steel metal bracket was bonded to each target surface with resin cement , and all specimens underwent thermal cycling. The shear bond strength of the specimens was measured by a universal testing machine. A scanning electron microscope , three-dimensional optical surface-profiler , and stereoscopic microscope were used to image the zirconia surfaces. The data were analyzed with one-way analyses of variance and the Fisher exact test. Results : Group GZ showed significantly lower shear bond strength than did the other groups. No statistically significant differences were found among groups NZ , GP , and GZP. All specimens in group GZ showed adhesive failure between the zirconia and resin cement. In groups NZ and GP , bonding failed at the interface between the resin cement and bracket base or showed complex adhesive and cohesive failure. Conclusions : Porcelain primer is the more appropriate choice for bonding a metal bracket to the surface of a full-contour glazed zirconia crown with resin cement . Objective : The aims of the present study were to evaluate the changes in the maximum lip-closing force ( MLF ) after orthodontic treatment with or without premolar extractions and verify the correlation of these changes with dentoskeletal changes. Methods : In total , 17 women who underwent nonextraction orthodontic treatment and 15 women who underwent orthodontic treatment with extraction of all four first premolars were included in this retrospective study. For all patients , lateral cephalograms and dental models were measured before ( T0 ) and after ( T1 ) treatment. In addition , MLF was measured at both time points using the Lip De Cum LDC-110R® device. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate changes in clinical variables and MLF and their correlations. Results : Both groups showed similar skeletal patterns , although the extraction group showed greater proclination of the maxillary and mandibular incisors and lip protrusion compared to the nonextraction group at T0. MLF at T0 was comparable between the two groups. The reduction in the arch width and depth and incisor retroclination from T0 to T1 were more pronounced in the extraction group than in the nonextraction group. MLF in the extraction group significantly increased during the treatment period , and this increase was significantly greater than that in the nonextraction group. The increase in MLF was found to be correlated with the increase in the interincisal angle and decrease in the intermolar width , arch depth , and incisor-mandibular plane angle. Conclusions : This study suggests that MLF increases to a greater extent during extraction orthodontic treatment than during nonextraction orthodontic treatment . The aim of this case report was to describe an innovative orthodontic treatment method that combined surgical and orthodontic techniques. The novel method was used to achieve a positive result in a case of moderate crowding by employing a computer-guided piezocision procedure followed by the use of clear aligners. A 23-year-old woman had a malocclusion with moderate crowding. Her periodontal indices , oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL ) , and treatment time were evaluated. The treatment included interproximal corticotomy cuts extending through the entire thickness of the cortical layer , without a full-thickness flap reflection. This was achieved with a three-dimensionally printed surgical guide using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing. Orthodontic force was applied to the teeth immediately after surgery by using clear appliances for better control of tooth movement. The total treatment time was 8 months. The periodontal indices improved after crowding correction , but the oral health impact profile showed a slight deterioration of OHRQoL during the 3 days following surgery. At the 2-year retention follow-up , the stability of treatment was excellent. The reduction in surgical time and patient discomfort , increased periodontal safety and patient acceptability , and accurate control of orthodontic movement without the risk of losing anchorage may encourage the use of this combined technique in appropriate cases . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of polymer- and rhodium-coated wires compared to uncoated wires by measuring the frictional forces using self-ligation brackets. Methods:0.016-inch nickel titanium ( NiTi ) wires and 0.017 _ 0.025-inch stainless steel ( SS ) wires were used , and the angulations between the brackets and wires were set to 0° , 5° , and 10°. Upper maxillary premolar brackets ( Clippy-C® ) with a 0.022-inch slot were selected for the study and a tensile test was performed with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. The maximum static frictional forces and kinetic frictional forces were recorded and compared. Results : The maximum static frictional forces and the kinetic frictional forces of coated wires were equal to or higher than those of the uncoated wires ( p < 0.05 ) . The maximum static frictional forces of rhodium-coated wires were significantly higher than those of polymer-coated wires when the angulations between the brackets and wires were set to ( i ) 5° in the 0.016-inch NiTi wires and ( ii ) all angulations in the 0.017 _ 0.025-inch SS wires ( p < 0.05 ) . The kinetic frictional forces of rhodium-coated wires were higher than those of polymer-coated wires , except when the angulations were set to 0° in the 0.016-inch NiTi wires ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Although the frictional forces of the coated wires with regards to aesthetics were equal to or greater than those of the uncoated wires , a study under similar conditions regarding the oral cavity is needed in order to establish the clinical implications . Objective : The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate and compare the changes in the pharyngeal airway ( PA ) , maxillary sinus volume , and skeletal parameters after rapid maxillary expansion ( RME ) and alternate rapid maxillary expansion and constriction ( Alt-RAMEC ) followed by facemask ( FM ) therapy. Methods : The records of 40 patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion due to maxillary retrognathism were collected , and the patients were assigned into two groups. The first group comprised 8 male and 12 female patients ( mean age , 10.0 ± 1.1 years ) treated using RME/FM for an average of 10 months. The second group comprised 10 male and 10 female patients ( mean age , 9.64 ± 1.3 years ) treated using Alt-RAMEC/FM for an average of 12 months. Cone-beam computed tomography images acquired before ( T0 ) and after treatment ( T1 ) were evaluated. Results : Regarding the skeletal effects , significant differences between the groups were the increase in ANS-HRP ( perpendicular distance of ANS to the horizontal reference plane , 0.99 mm , p < 0.05 ) in the Alt-RAMEC/FM group and the decrease in PP-SN ( palatal plane to Sella-Nasion plane , 0.93° , p < 0.05 ) in the RME/FM group. Maxillary sinus volumes increased significantly in both the groups , and the increase was statistically significantly higher in the Alt-RAMEC/FM group. Although no significant intergroup differences were observed in PA volumes , both lower ( 1,011.19 mm3 ) and total ( 1,601.21 mm3 ) , PA volume increased significantly in the Alt-RAMEC/FM group. Conclusions : The different expansion devices and protocols used with FM therapy do not seem to affect the forward movement of the maxilla and PA volumes. In contrast , the increase in maxillary sinus volume was greater in the Alt-RAMEC/FM protocol . Objective : To quantify , for each activation , the effect of preactivations of differing distribution and intensity on the neutral position of T-loops ( 7-mm height ) , specifically the horizontal force , moment to force ( M/F ) ratio , and load to deflection ratio. Methods : A total 100 loops measuring 0.017 _ 0.025 inches in cross-section were divided into two groups ( n = 50 each ) according to composition , either stainless steel or beta-titanium. The two groups were further divided into five subgroups , 10 loops each , corresponding to the five preactivations tested : preactivations with occlusal distribution ( 0° , 20° , and 40° ) , gingival distribution ( 20° ) , and occlusal-gingival distribution ( 40° ) . The loops were subjected to a total activation of 6-mm with 0.5-mm iterations. Statistical analysis was performed using comprised ANOVA and Bonferoni multiple comparison tests , with a significance level of 5 % . Results : The location and intensity of preactivation influenced the force intensity. For the M/F ratio , the highest value achieved without preactivation was lower than the height of the loop. Without preactivation , the M/F ratio increased with activation , while the opposite effect was observed with preactivation. The increase in the M/F ratio was greater when the preactivation distribution was partially or fully gingival. Conclusions : Depending on the preactivation distribution , displacement of uprights is higher or lower than the activation , which is a factor to consider in clinical practice . Objective : The aim of this study was to determine cephalometric factors that help predict favorable soft-tissue profile outcomes following treatment with the Class II Twin-block appliance. Methods : Pre- and post-treatment lateral cephalograms of 45 patients treated with the Class II Twin-block appliance were retrospectively analyzed. Profile silhouettes were drawn from the cephalograms and evaluated by three orthodontists in order to determine the extent of improvement. Samples were divided into a favorable group ( upper 30 % of visual analogue scale [ VAS ] scores , n = 14 ) and an unfavorable group ( lower 30 % of VAS scores , n = 14 ) . Skeletal and soft-tissue measurements were performed on the cephalograms and an intergroup comparison was conducted. Results : An independentt-test revealed that the following pre-treatment values were lower in the favorable group compared to the unfavorable group : lower incisor to mandibular plane angle , lower incisor to pogonion distance , point A-nasion-point B angle , sella-nasion line ( SN ) to maxillary plane angle , SN to mandibular plane angle , gonial angle , and symphysis inclination. The favorable group had a larger incisor inclination to occlusal plane. Moreover , the favorable group showed larger post-treatment changes in gonial angle , B point projection , and pogonion projection than did the unfavorable group. Conclusions : Class II malocclusion patients with a low divergent skeletal pattern and reduced lower incisor protrusions are likely to show more improvement in soft-tissue profile outcomes following Class II Twin-block treatment . Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate the facial dimensions of young adult women with a preferred facial appearance and compare the results with those from the general population. Methods : Twenty-five linear , nine angular , and three area measurements were made and four ratios were calculated using a sample of standardized frontal and lateral photographs of 46 young adult women with a preferred facial appearance ( Miss Korea group ) and 44 young adult women from the general population ( control group ) . Differences between the two groups were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) . Results : Compared with the control group , the Miss Korea group exhibited a significantly greater facial height , total facial height ( TFH ; trichion-menton ) , facial width ( tragus right-tragus left ) , facial depth ( tragus-true vertical line ) , and trichion-nasion/TFH ratio and smaller subnasale-menton/TFH and facial width/TFH ratios. Furthermore , the control group had smaller intercanthal and interpupillary widths. Conclusions : The Miss Korea group exhibited longer , wider , and deeper faces compared with those from the general population. Furthermore , the Miss Korea group had larger eyes , longer but less protruded noses , longer and more retruded lower lips and chins , larger lip vermilion areas , and smaller labiomental angles. These results suggest that the latest trends in facial esthetics should be considered during diagnosis and treatment planning for young women with dentofacial abnormalities . Objective : To determine the unique contribution of geometrical design characteristics of orthodontic mini-implants on maximum insertion torque while controlling for the influence of cortical bone thickness. Methods : Total number of 100 cylindrical orthodontic mini-implants was used. Geometrical design characteristics of ten specimens of ten types of cylindrical self-drilling orthodontic mini-implants ( Ortho Easy® , Aarhus , and Dual Top ) with diameters ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 mm and lengths of 6 and 8 mm were measured. Maximum insertion torque was recorded during manual insertion of mini-implants into bone samples. Cortical bone thickness was measured. Retrieved data were analyzed in a multiple regression model. Results : Significant predictors for higher maximum insertion torque included larger outer diameter of implant , higher lead angle of thread , and thicker cortical bone , and their unique contribution to maximum insertion torque was 12.3 % , 10.7 % , and 24.7 % , respectively. Conclusions : The maximum insertion torque values are best controlled by choosing an implant diameter and lead angle according to the assessed thickness of cortical bone . Objective : To assess the labial and lingual alveolar bone thickness in adults with maxillary central incisors of different inclination by cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) . Methods : Ninety maxillary central incisors from 45 patients were divided into three groups based on the maxillary central incisors to palatal plane angle ; lingual-inclined , normal , and labial-inclined. Reformatted CBCT images were used to measure the labial and lingual alveolar bone thickness ( ABT ) at intervals corresponding to every 1/10 of the root length. The sum of labial ABT and lingual ABT at the level of the root apex was used to calculate the total ABT ( TABT ) . The number of teeth exhibiting alveolar fenestration and dehiscence in each group was also tallied. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey 's honestly significant difference test were applied for statistical analysis. Results : The labial ABT and TABT values at the root apex in the lingual-inclined group were significantly lower than in the other groups ( p < 0.05 ) . Lingual and labial ABT values were very low at the cervical level in the lingual-inclined and normal groups. There was a higher prevalence of alveolar fenestration in the lingual-inclined group. Conclusions : Lingual-inclined maxillary central incisors have less bone support at the level of the root apex and a greater frequency of alveolar bone defects than normal maxillary central incisors. The bone plate at the marginal level is also very thin . Objective : This retrospective study compared the three-dimensional ( 3D ) structure of mandibular condyles between adults with and without facial asymmetry , and whether it influences menton deviation. Methods : Sixty adult patients were classified into symmetry and asymmetry groups based on the menton deviation on postero-anterior radiographs. The right/left differences of 3D measurements were compared between the two groups , and measurements were compared separately on the right and left sides. The correlations between menton deviation and the right/left differences were analyzed. Results : The mediolateral dimension , neck length , condylar angles to the anteroposterior reference ( PO ) and midsagittal reference planes , and neck and head volumes showed significantly larger right/left differences in the asymmetry group compared to the symmetry group. Separate comparisons of the right and left sides between the two groups showed that the neck was significantly shorter and neck and head volumes were significantly smaller on the left side , which was deviated side in the asymmetry group. Pearson 's correlation analysis showed significant positive correlations of menton deviation with right/left differences in neck length , condylar angle to the PO plane , and neck and head volumes in the asymmetry group. Conclusions : In individuals with facial asymmetry , menton deviation is associated with the right/left differences caused by a smaller condyle on the deviated side , particularly in neck length and neck and head volumes . For patients with bimaxillary protrusion , significant retraction and intrusion of the anterior teeth are sometimes essential to improve the facial profile. However , severe root resorption of the maxillary incisors occasionally occurs after treatment because of various factors. For instance , it has been reported that approximation or invasion of the incisive canal by the anterior tooth roots during retraction may cause apical root damage. Thus , determination of the position of the maxillary incisors is key for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning in such cases. Cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) may be useful for simulating the post-treatment position of the maxillary incisors and surrounding structures in order to ensure safe teeth movement. Here , we present a case of Class II malocclusion with bimaxillary protrusion , wherein apical root damage due to treatment was minimized by pretreatment evaluation of the anatomical structures and simulation of the maxillary central incisor movement using CBCT. Considerable retraction and intrusion of the maxillary incisors , which resulted in a significant improvement in the facial profile and smile , were achieved without severe root resorption. Our findings suggest that CBCT-based diagnosis and treatment simulation may facilitate safe and dynamic orthodontic tooth movement , particularly in patients requiring maximum anterior tooth retraction . Objective : The purpose of this study was to assess rotational patterns of dentofacial structures according to different vertical skeletal patterns by cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) and analyze their influence on menton deviation in skeletal Class III deformity with mandibular asymmetry. Methods : The control group consisted of 30 young adults ( 15 men , 15 women ) without any severe skeletal deformity. The asymmetry group included 55 adults ( 28 men , 27 women ) with skeletal Class III deformity and at least 3-mm menton deviation from the midsagittal plane ; it was divided into the hyperdivergent and hypodivergent subgroups using a mandibular plane angle cutoff of 35°. Fourteen rotational variables of the dental arches and mandible were measured and compared among the groups. Correlations between menton deviation and the other variables were evaluated. Results : The asymmetry group showed significantly larger measurements of roll and yaw in the mandible than the control group. The hypodivergent subgroup showed significant differences in maxillary posterior measurements of yaw ( p < 0.01 ) and maxillary anterior shift ( p < 0.05 ) compared with the hyperdivergent subgroup. All the mandibular measurements had significant correlations with menton deviation ( p < 0.01 ) . Most measurements of roll were positively correlated with one another ( p < 0.01 ) . Measurements of yaw and roll in the posterior regions were also positively correlated ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Menton deviation in skeletal Class III deformity with mandibular asymmetry is influenced by rotation of mandibular posterior dentofacial structures. The rotational patterns vary slightly according to the vertical skeletal pattern . Condylar hyperplasia ( CH ) is a rare disorder characterized by excessive bone growth that almost always presents unilaterally , resulting in facial asymmetry. Classification of the different types of CH can differ depending on the authors. Correct diagnosis is critical in determining the proper treatments and timing. This paper is a review of the recent literature on the epidemiology , etiology , diagnosis , classification , and surgical treatments of CH . Objective : To investigate how bracket slot size affects the direction of maxillary anterior tooth movement whenen-masseretraction is performed in sliding mechanics using an induction-heating typodont simulation system. Methods : An induction-heating typodont simulation system was designed based on the Calorific Machine system. The typodont included metal anterior and resin posterior teeth embedded in a sticky wax arch. Three bracket slot groups ( 0.018 , 0.020 , and 0.022 inch [ in ] ) were tested. A retraction force of 250 g was applied in the posterior-superior direction. Results : In the anteroposterior direction , the cusp tip of the canine in the 0.020-in slot group moved more distally than in the 0.018-in slot group. In the vertical direction , all six anterior teeth were intruded in the 0.018-in slot group and extruded in the 0.020- and 0.022-in slot groups. The lateral incisor was significantly extruded in the 0.020- and 0.022-in slot groups. Significant differences in the crown linguoversion were found between the 0.018- and 0.020-in slot groups and 0.018- and 0.022-in slot groups for the central incisor and between the 0.018- and 0.022-in slot groups and 0.020- and 0.022-in slot groups for the canine. In the 0.018-in slot group , all anterior teeth showed crown mesial angulation. Significant differences were found between the 0.018- and 0.022-in slot groups for the lateral incisor and between the 0.018- and 0.020-in slot groups and 0.018- and 0.022-in slot groups for the canine. Conclusions : Use of 0.018-in slot brackets was effective for preventing extrusion and crown linguoversion of anterior teeth in sliding mechanics . Objective : To analyze the long-term changes in maxillary arch widths and buccal corridor ratios in orthodontic patients treated with and without premolar extractions. Methods : The study included 53 patients who were divided into the extraction ( n = 28 ) and nonextraction ( n = 25 ) groups. These patients had complete orthodontic records from the pretreatment ( T1 ) , posttreatment ( T2 ) , and postretention ( T3 ) periods. Their mean retention and postretention times were 4 years 2 months and 17 years 8 months , respectively. Dental models and smiling photographs from all three periods were digitized to compare the changes in three dental arch width measurements and three buccal corridor ratios over time between the extraction and nonextraction groups. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance tests.Post-hocmultiple comparisons were made using Bonferroni correction. Results : Soft-tissue extension during smiling increased with age in both groups. The maximum dental width to smile width ratio ( MDW/SW ) also showed a favorable increase with treatment in both groups ( p < 0.05 ) , and remained virtually stable at T3 ( p > 0.05 ) . According to the MDW/SW ratio , the mean difference in the buccal corridor space of the two groups was 2.4 ± 0.2 % at T3. Additionally , no significant group _ time interaction was found for any of the buccal corridor ratios studied. Conclusions : Premolar extractions did not negatively affect transverse maxillary arch widths and buccal corridor ratios. The long-term outcome of orthodontic treatment was comparable between the study groups . Objective : This study was performed to compare the perception of pain between patients treated with passive self-ligating fixed appliances and those treated with Invisalign aligners. Methods : This prospective study conducted in Saudi Arabia used an estimated sample of 64 patients from a private dental clinic. After obtaining written informed consent , the patients were divided into two groups ; one group ( n = 32 ) was treated using passive self-ligating fixed appliances and the other group ( n = 32 ) using Invisalign®aligners. Immediately after fitting the appliances , the patients ' perception of pain was evaluated through a close-ended and coded self-administrated questionnaire by using a visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Their responses were recorded at 4 hours , 24 hours , day 3 , and day 7. Mann-WhitneyU-test , Kruskal-Wallis test , and Pearson 's chi-square test were performed for statistical analysis. Results : A lower percentage of patients treated with Invisalign aligners reported pain than did patients treated with passive self-ligating fixed appliances , and these differences were statistically significant ( p= 0.001 ) . Similarly , the mean VAS score for the Invisalign group was significantly lower than that for the passive self-ligating fixed appliance group at different intervals during the first week of treatment. The intensity of pain with both appliances peaked at 24 hours ( mean VAS score , 3.87 ) and was lowest ( mean VAS score , 1.62 ) on day 7. Conclusions : During the first week of orthodontic treatment , patients treated with Invisalign aligners reported lower pain than did those treated with passive self-ligating fixed appliances . Objective : This study was performed to investigate the alveolar bone of lower incisors in skeletal Class III adults of different vertical facial patterns and to compare it with that of Class I adults using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images. Methods : CBCT images of 90 skeletal Class III and 29 Class I patients were evaluated. Class III subjects were divided by mandibular plane angle : high ( SN-MP > 38.0° ) , normal ( 30.0° < SN-MP < 37.0° ) , and low ( SN-MP < 28.0° ) groups. Buccolingual alveolar bone thickness was measured using CBCT images of mandibular incisors at alveolar crest and 3 , 6 , and 9 mm apical levels. Linear mixed model , Bonferronipost-hoctest , and Pearson correlation analysis were used for statistical significance. Results : Buccolingual alveolar bone in Class III high , normal and low angle subjects was not significantly different at alveolar crest and 3 mm apical level while lingual bone was thicker at 6 and 9 mm apical levels than on buccal side. Class III high angle group had thinner alveolar bone at all levels except at buccal alveolar crest and 9 mm apical level on lingual side compared to the Class I group. Class III high angle group showed thinner alveolar bone than the Class III normal or low angle groups in most regions. Mandibular plane angle showed negative correlations with mandibular anterior alveolar bone thickness. Conclusions : Skeletal Class III subjects with high mandibular plane angles showed thinner mandibular alveolar bone in most areas compared to normal or low angle subjects. Mandibular plane angle was negatively correlated with buccolingual alveolar bone thickness . Objective : This study aimed to investigate the current data regarding age , sex , and Angle Classification of Korean orthodontic patients and influence of these factors on the tendency to undergo extraction and orthognathic surgery. Methods : The recent trends of Korean orthodontic patients were assessed using questionnaire survey. The questionnaires were e-mailed to orthodontists who met the study criteria ; 58 % of the orthodontists opened the e-mails , and 27.7 % replied to the e-mails. In all , the medical records of 11,340 patients who underwent orthodontic treatment at private clinics and small dental hospitals in Korea were analyzed. Results : The percentage of female patients in the study sample was 69.6 % , and the average age of the patients was 19.87 years. The percentage of patients who were older than 19 years was 50.2 % . Class II and Class III malocclusions were noted in 33.6 % and 23.6 % of patients , respectively. Extraction and orthognathic surgery were performed in 60.4 % and 6.9 % of patients , respectively. Conclusions : The results showed that there were a high percentage of adult , Class II malocclusion and extraction patients in private practices and small dental hospitals during the study period. Further , a relatively high proportion of adult patients opted to undergo orthognathic surgery . Objective : The purpose of this in vitro study was to examine the effects of fluoridated , casein phosphopeptide.amorphous calcium phosphate complex ( CPP-ACP ) -containing , and functionalized β-tricalcium phosphate ( fTCP ) -containing toothpastes on remineralization of white spot lesions ( WSLs ) by using Quantitative light-induced fluorescence ( QLF-D ) Biluminator 2. Methods : Forty-eight premolars , extracted for orthodontic reasons from 12 patients , with artificially induced WSLs were randomly and equally assigned to four treatment groups : fluoride ( 1,000 ppm ) , CPP-ACP , fTCP ( with sodium fluoride ) , and control ( deionized water ) groups. Specimens were treated twice daily for 2 weeks and stored in saliva solution ( 1:1 mixture of artificial and human stimulated saliva ) otherwise. QLF-D Biluminator 2 was used to measure changes in fluorescence , indicating alterations in the mineral contents of the WSLs , immediately before and after the 2 weeks of treatment. Results : Fluorescence greatly increased in the fTCP and CPP-ACP groups compared with the fluoride and control groups , which did not show significant differences. Conclusions : fTCP- and CPP-ACP-containing toothpastes seem to be more effective in reducing WSLs than 1,000-ppm fluoride-containing toothpastes . Objective : This study is performed to investigate the trend of health care ( HC ) utilization among cleft lip and/or palate ( CL/P ) during 2007-2016 by using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service ( KNHIS ) . Methods : The KNHIS data were reorganized to count a specific patient only once for a specific year. Cleft type ( cleft lip [ CL ] , cleft palate [ CP ] , and cleft lip and palate [ CLP ] ) , sex , and age at HC utilization were investigated. The study period was divided into the first half ( 2007-2011 ) and the last half ( 2012-2016 ) . The utilization number and rate per 1,000 population were calculated for the total population and for new-born patients. Independentt-test and one-way analysis of variance were used for statistical analyses. Results : The total CL/P population ( n = 48,707 ) comprised 19.2 % CLP , 35.5 % CL , and 45.3 % CP ( CLP < CL < CP ; p < 0.001 ) . Their HC utilization rate increased from 0.066 in 2007 to 0.118 in 2016. The new-born patient population ( n = 7,617 ) comprised 18.6 % CLP , 30.4 % CL , and 51.0 % CP ( CLP < CL < CP ; p < 0.001 ) . Their HC utilization rate increased from 1.12 in 2007 to 1.74 in 2016. An examination of the utilization number and rate among new-born patients revealed CP exhibited a female-dominant pattern ( allp < 0.01 ) , while CL and CLP exhibited a male-dominant pattern ( allp < 0.01 ) . However , utilization number showed no difference by sex and cleft type between 2007-2011 and 2012-2016. Conclusions : These results might serve as a guideline for HC utilization among patients with CL/P . Orthodontic treatment is more complicated when both soft and hard tissues must be considered because an impacted maxillary canine has important effects on function and esthetics. Compared with extraction of impacted maxillary canines , exposure followed by orthodontic traction can improve esthetics and better protect the patient 's teeth and alveolar bone. Therefore , in order to achieve desirable tooth movement with minimal unexpected complications , a precise diagnosis is indispensable to establish an effective and efficient force system. In this report , we describe the case of a 31-year-old patient who had a labio-palatal horizontally impacted maxillary left canine with a severe occlusal alveolar bone defect and a missing maxillary left first premolar. Herein , with the aid of three-dimensional imaging , sequential traction was performed with a three-directional force device that finally achieved acceptable occlusion by bringing the horizontally impacted maxillary left canine into alignment. The maxillary left canine had normal gingival contours and was surrounded by a substantial amount of regenerated alveolar bone. The 1-year follow-up stability assessment demonstrated that the esthetic and functional outcomes were successful . Objective : The purposes of this study were 1 ) to classify lingual dental arch form types based on the lingual bracket points and 2 ) to provide a new lingual arch form template based on this classification for clinical application through the analysis of three-dimensional virtual models of normal occlusion sample. Methods : Maxillary and mandibular casts of 115 young adults with normal occlusion were scanned in their occluded positions and lingual bracket points were digitized on the virtual models by using Rapidform 2006 software. Sixty-eight cases ( dataset 1 ) were used in K-means cluster analysis to classify arch forms with intercanine , interpremolar and intermolar widths and width/depth ratios as determinants. The best-fit curves of the mean arch forms were generated. The remaining cases ( dataset 2 ) were mapped into the obtained clusters and a multivariate test was performed to assess the differences between the clusters. Results : Four-cluster classification demonstrated maximum intercluster distance. Wide , narrow , tapering , and ovoid types were described according to the intercanine and intermolar widths and their best-fit curves were depicted. No significant differences in arch depths existed among the clusters. Strong to moderate correlations were found between maxillary and mandibular arch widths. Conclusions : Lingual arch forms have been classified into 4 types based on their anterior and posterior dimensions. A template of the 4 arch forms has been depicted. Three-dimensional analysis of the lingual bracket points provides more accurate identification of arch form and , consequently , archwire selection . Objective : To investigate the effects of frontal facial type ( FFT ) and sex on preferred chin projection ( CP ) in three-dimensional ( 3D ) facial images. Methods : Six 3D facial images were acquired using a 3D facial scanner ( euryprosopic [ Eury-FFT ] , mesoprosopic [ Meso-FFT ] , and leptoprosopic [ Lepto-FFT ] for each sex ) . After normal CP in each 3D facial image was set to 10° of the facial profile angle ( glabella-subnasale-pogonion ) , CPs were morphed by gradations of 2° from normal ( moderately protrusive [ 6° ] , slightly protrusive [ 8° ] , slightly retrusive [ 12° ] , and moderately retrusive [ 14° ] ) . Seventy-five dental students ( 48 men and 27 women ) were asked to rate the CPs ( 6° , 8° , 10° , 12° , and 14° ) from the most to least preferred in each 3D image. Statistical analyses included the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test , Kruskal-Wallis test , and Bonferroni correction. Results : No significant difference was observed in the distribution of preferred CP in the same FFT between male and female evaluators. In Meso-FFT , the normal CP was the most preferred without any sex difference. However , in Eury-FFT , the slightly protrusive CP was favored in male 3D images , but the normal CP was preferred in female 3D images. In Lepto-FFT , the normal CP was favored in male 3D images , whereas the slightly retrusive CP was favored in female 3D images. The mean preferred CP angle differed significantly according to FFT ( Eury-FFT : male , 8.7° , female , 9.9° ; Meso-FFT : male , 9.8° , female , 10.7° ; Lepto-FFT : male , 10.8° , female , 11.4° ; p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : Our findings might serve as guidelines for setting the preferred CP according to FFT and sex . Objective : This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the stability of mandibular arch orthodontic treatment outcomes between passive self-ligating and conventional systems during 6 months of retention. Methods : Fortyseven orthodontic patients with mild to moderate crowding malocclusions not requiring extraction were recruited based on inclusion criteria. Patients ( mean age 21.58 ± 2.94 years ) were randomized into two groups to receive either passive self-ligating ( Damon® 3MX , n = 23 ) or conventional system ( Gemini MBT , n = 24 ) orthodontic treatment. Direct measurements of the final sample comprising 20 study models per group were performed using a digital caliper at the debonding stage , and 1 month , 3 months , and 6 months after debonding. Pairedt-test , independentt-test , and non-parametric test were used for statistical analysis. Results : A significant increase ( p < 0.01 ) in incisor irregularity was observed in both self-ligating and conventional system groups. A significant reduction ( p < 0.01 ) in second interpremolar width was observed in both groups. Mandibular arch length decreased significantly ( p= 0.001 ) in the conventional system group but not in the self-ligating system group. A similar pattern of stability was observed for intercanine width , first interpremolar width , intermolar width , and arch depth throughout the 6-month retention period after debonding. Comparison of incisor irregularity and arch dimension changes between self-ligating system and conventional system groups during the 6 months were non-significant. Conclusions : The stability of treatment outcomes for mild to moderate crowding malocclusions was similar between the self-ligating system and conventional system during the first 6 months of retention . Many clinicians expect complete healing after the removal of temporary anchorage devices , but clinical examination may reveal scar-like tissue. This report presents the typical features of scarring detected after the removal of miniscrews , and the clinical outcome of scar revision along with its pathologic features . Objective : To gain basic information regarding the biologic stability of plasma ion-implanted miniscrews and their potential clinical applications. Methods : Sixteen plasma ion-implanted and 16 sandblasted and acid-etched ( SLA ) miniscrews were bilaterally inserted in the mandibles of 4 beagles ( 2 miniscrews of each type per quadrant ) . Then , 250 - 300 gm of force from Ni-Ti coil springs was applied for 2 different periods : 12 weeks on one side and 3 weeks contralaterally. Thereafter , the animals were sacrificed and mandibular specimens including the miniscrews were collected. The insertion torque and mobility were compared between the groups. The bone-implant contact and bone volume ratio were calculated within 800 µm of the miniscrews and compared between the loading periods. The number of osteoblasts was also quantified. The measurements were expressed as percentages and analyzed by independent t-tests ( p < 0.05 ) . Results : No significant differences in any of the analyzed parameters were noted between the groups. Conclusions : The preliminary findings indicate that plasma ion-implanted miniscrews have similar biologic characteristics to SLA miniscrews in terms of insertion torque , mobility , bone-implant contact rate , and bone volume rate . Objective : To propose a three-dimensional ( 3D ) method for evaluating temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) changes during Twin-block treatment. Methods : Seventeen patients with Class II division 1 malocclusion treated using Twin-block and nine untreated patients with a similar malocclusion were included in this research. We collected their cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) data from before and 8 months after treatment. Segmentations were constructed using ITK-SNAP. Condylar volume and superficial area were measured using 3D Slicer. The 3D landmarks were identified on CBCT images by using Dolphin software to assess the condylar positional relationship. 3D models of the mandible and glenoid fossa of the patients were constructed and registered via voxel-based superimposition using 3D Slicer. Thereafter , skeletal changes could be visualized using 3DMeshMetric in any direction of the superimposition on a color-coded map. All the superimpositions were measured using the same scale on the distance color-coded map , in which red color represents overgrowth and blue color represents resorption. Results : Significant differences were observed in condylar volume , superficial area , and condylar position in both groups after 8 months. Compared with the control group ( CG ) , the Twin-block group exhibited more obvious condyle-fossa modifications and joint positional changes. Moreover , on the color-coded map , more obvious condyle-fossa modifications could be observed in the posterior and superior directions in the Twin-block group than in the CG. Conclusions : We successfully established a 3D method for measuring and evaluating TMJ changes caused by Twin-block treatment. The treatment produced a larger condylar size and caused condylar positional changes . Objective : This study was performed to investigate the effects of external tooth bleaching with flouridation on the appearance of white spot lesions ( WSLs ) in vitro. Methods : In total , 125 bracket-bonded bovine incisor enamel blocks with artificial WSLs were randomly divided into a control group and four treatment groups ( home bleaching , home bleaching + fluoridation , in-office bleaching , and in-office bleaching + fluoridation ) . A spectroradiometer ( SR ) and digital images ( DIs ) were used to evaluate colorimetric parameters ( Commission Internationale l'Eclairage L*a*b* ) for all specimens. Color measurements were obtained before WSL formation ( T1 ) , after WSL formation ( T2 ) , and after completion of the external tooth bleaching treatment ( T3 ) . Results : The SR-based color change after bleaching was significantly greater in the treatment groups than in the control group ( p < 0.05 ) . SR-based lightness ( L* ) and red-green ( a* ) values were significantly higher at T2 than at T1 ( p < 0.001 ) , with no significant changes in yellow-blue ( b* ) values. At T3 , SR-based L*values had increased while a*and b*values had decreased in the treatment groups ( p < 0.001 ) . The DI-based color difference between the sound enamel and WSL areas ( E*DI ) increased significantly from T1 to T2 in all groups ( p < 0.001 ) and significantly decreased from T2 to T3 in the treatment groups ( p < 0.001 ) . No significant differences in E*DI at T3 were shown between the four treatment groups ( p > 0.05 ) . Conclusions : The findings of this study suggested that external tooth bleaching with fluoridation can alleviate the conspicuity of WSLs . Facial asymmetry can be classified into the rolling-dominant type ( R-type ) , translation-dominant type ( T-type ) , yawing-dominant type ( Y-type ) , and atypical type ( A-type ) based on the distorted skeletal components that cause canting , translation , and yawing of the maxilla and/or mandible. Each facial asymmetry type represents dentoalveolar compensations in three dimensions that correspond to the main skeletal discrepancies. To obtain sufficient surgical correction , it is necessary to analyze the main skeletal discrepancies contributing to the facial asymmetry and then the skeletal-dental relationships in the maxilla and mandible separately. Particularly in cases of facial asymmetry accompanied by mandibular yawing , it is not simple to establish pre-surgical goals of tooth movement since chin deviation and posterior gonial prominence can be either aggravated or compromised according to the direction of mandibular yawing. Thus , strategic dentoalveolar decompensations targeting the real basal skeletal discrepancies should be performed during presurgical orthodontic treatment to allow for sufficient skeletal correction with stability. In this report , we document targeted decompensation of two asymmetry patients focusing on more complicated yaw-dependent types than others : Y-type and A-type. This may suggest a clinical guideline on the targeted decompensation in patient with different types of facial asymmetries . Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of silverized elastomers on mutans streptococci in dental plaque. Methods : Forty patients undergoing orthodontic treatment were randomly placed into 1 of 2 groups. We examined the maxillary right and left central incisors and premolars , and the mandibular right and left canines of all participants. We ligated the right maxillary and left mandibular teeth of the participants in group 1 with silverized elastomers and ligated their contralateral teeth with conventional elastomers. We ligated the left maxillary teeth and right mandibular teeth of group 2 participants with silverized elastomers. Each participant visited the clinic 4 times at 3-week intervals. We applied the elastomers to the teeth on one side of each patient 's mouth during their first visit. During the second visit , the elastomers were removed for microbiological analysis and replaced with steel ligatures. During the third visit , we used silverized elastomers to ligate the teeth contralateral to those treated on the first visit. The elastomers were removed during the fourth visit , and microbiological analyses were performed. We compared the quantity of bacteria on silverized and conventional elastomers at the 0.05 level of significance. Results : The percentage of mutans streptococci was not significantly different in cultures of dental plaque from the silverized and the conventional elastomers ( p > 0.05 ) . Conclusions : There was no significant difference between the antimicrobial effect of the silverized elastomers and that of the conventional elastomers . Fusion of teeth is a developmental anomaly. It occurs at the stage of tooth formation , which determines the shape and size of the tooth crown , when one or more teeth fuse at the dentin level during the morphodifferentiation of the dental germs. Such teeth show macrodontia and may cause crowding , as well as esthetic and endodontic problems. In this article , we report a rare case of a maxillary central incisor fused to a supernumerary tooth showing labial and palatal talon cusps , which was orthodontically moved across the midpalatal suture. A 13-year-old Caucasian boy sought treatment for the unesthetic appearance of his maxillary central incisor and anterior crowding. He was rehabilitated successfully via a multidisciplinary approach involving orthodontic , nonsurgical endodontic , periodontal , and prosthodontic treatments. After a 26-month treatment period , the patient 's macroesthetics and microesthetics were improved. The overall improvement of this macrodontic tooth and its surrounding tissues through multidisciplinary treatment was documented using cone-beam computed tomography . Objective : We evaluated the effects of tooth displacement on frictional force when conventional ligating lingual brackets ( CL-LBs ) , CL-LBs with a narrow bracket width , and self-ligating lingual brackets ( SL-LBs ) were used with initial leveling and alignment wires. Methods : CL-LBs ( 7th Generation ) , CL-LBs with a narrow bracket width ( STb ) , and SL-LBs ( In-Ovation L ) were tested under three tooth displacement conditions : no displacement ( control ) ; a 2-mm palatal displacement ( PD ) of the maxillary right lateral incisor ( MXLI ) ; and a 2-mm gingival displacement ( GD ) of the maxillary right canine ( MXC ) ( nine groups , n = 7 per group ) . A stereolithographic typodont system and artificial saliva were used. Static and kinetic frictional forces ( SFF and KFF , respectively ) were measured while drawing a 0.013-inch copper-nickel-titanium archwire through brackets at 0.5 mm/min for 5 minutes at 36.5. Results : The In-Ovation L exhibited lower SFF under control conditions and lower KFF under all displacement conditions than the 7th Generation and STb ( all p < 0.001 ) . No significant difference in SFF existed between the In-Ovation L and STb for a 2-mm GD of the MXC and 2-mm PD of the MXLI. A 2-mm GD of the MXC produced higher SFF and KFF than a 2-mm PD of the MXLI in all brackets ( all p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : CL-LBs with narrow bracket widths exhibited higher KFF than SL-LBs under tooth displacement conditions. CL-LBs and ligation methods should be developed to produce SFF and KFF as low as those in SL-LBs during the initial and leveling stage . Objective : This study aimed to explore the usefulness of adjunctive buccal and palatal corticotomy for adult maxillary expansion in an animal model using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) . Methods : Twelve adult sheep were randomly divided into two groups ( each n = 6 ) : a control group , where no treatment was administered , and a treatment group , where buccal and palatal corticotomy-assisted maxillary expansion was performed. CBCT scans were taken before ( T1 ) and after ( T2 ) treatment. Differences in all transverse dental and alveolar dimensions , alveolar width at crest level , hard palate level , horizontal bone loss , interdental cusp width and inter-root apex were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank and Mann-WhitneyU-tests. Kruskal-Wallis tests and pairwise comparisons were used to detect the significance of differences among the inter-premolar and inter-molar widths. Results : CBCT data revealed significant changes in all transverse dental and alveolar dimensions. The mean interpremolar alveolar width showed an increase of 2.29 to 3.62 mm at the hard palate level , 3.89 to 4.38 mm at the alveolar crest level , and 9.17 to 10.42 mm at the buccal cusp level. Dental changes in the vertical dimension were not significant. Conclusions : Our findings based on an adult animal model suggest that adjunctive buccal and palatal corticotomy can allow for both skeletal and dental expansion , with the amount of dental expansion exceeding that of skeletal expansion at alveolar crest and hard palate levels by two and three folds , respectively. Therefore , this treatment modality is potential to enhance the outcomes of maxillary expansion in adults . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between idiopathic scoliosis and facial deformity in the horizontal , vertical , and anteroposterior planes. Methods : A total of 123 female patients aged 14 years or older , who visited the Spine Clinic at the Department of Orthopedics , Korea University Guro Hospital for treatment of idiopathic scoliosis , were enrolled. Whole-spine anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were taken with the patient in a naturally erect position , and frontal and lateral cephalograms were taken in an erect position with the Frankfort horizontal line parallel to the floor. Scoliosis was classified according to the Cobb angle and Lenke classification of six curve types. Cephalometric tracing in all cases was carried out with V-Ceph 5.5 by the same orthodontist. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to determine whether any relation existed between each group of the idiopathic scoliosis classification and the cephalometric measurements of frontal and lateral cephalograms. Results : The measurements did not reveal any significant association between the Cobb angle and cephalometric measurements and between the curve type based on the Lenke classification and cephalometric measurements. Conclusions : Based on the results of this study , no apparent relation was observed between the severity of scoliosis and facial form variations in idiopathic scoliosis patients . Objective : Traditional retainers ( both metal and fiber-reinforced composite [ FRC ] ) have limitations , and a retainer made from more flexible ligature wires might be advantageous. We aimed to compare an experimental design with two traditional retainers. Methods : In this prospective preliminary clinical trial , 150 post-treatment patients were enrolled and randomly divided into three groups of 50 patients each to receive mandibular canine-to-canine retainers made of FRC , flexible spiral wire ( FSW ) , and twisted wire ( TW ) . The patients were monitored monthly. The time at which the first signs of breakage/debonding were detected was recorded. The success rates of the retainers were compared using chi-squared , Kaplan-Meier , and Cox proportional-hazard regression analyses ( α = 0.05 ) . Results : In total , 42 patients in the FRC group , 41 in the FSW group , and 45 in the TW group completed the study. The 2-year failure rates were 35.7 % in the FRC group , 26.8 % in the FSW group , and 17.8 % in the TW group. These rates differed insignificantly ( chi-squared p = 0.167 ) . According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis , failure occurred at 19.95 months in the FRC group , 21.37 months in the FSW group , and 22.36 months in the TW group. The differences between the survival rates in the three groups were not significant ( Cox regression p = 0.146 ) . Conclusions : Although the failure rate of the experimental retainer was two times lower than that of the FRC retainer , the difference was not statistically significant. The experimental TW retainer was successful , and larger studies are warranted to verify these results . Objective : The aims of this study were to investigate mandibular deformation under clenching and to estimate its effect on the stability of orthodontic mini-implants ( OMI ) . Methods : Three finite element models were constructed using computed tomography ( CT ) images of 3 adults with different mandibular plane angles ( A , low ; B , average ; and C , high ) . An OMI was placed between # 45 and # 46 in each model. Mandibular deformation under premolar and molar clenching was simulated. Comparisons were made between peri-orthodontic mini-implant compressive strain ( POMI-CSTN ) under clenching and orthodontic traction forces ( 150 g and 200 g ) . Results : Three models with different mandibular plane angles demonstrated different functional deformation characteristics. The compressive strains around the OMI were distributed mesiodistally rather than occlusogingivally. In model A , the maximum POMI-CSTN under clenching was observed at the mesial aspect of # 46 ( 1,401.75 microstrain [ µE ] ) , and similar maximum POMI-CSTN was observed under a traction force of 150 g ( 1,415 µE ) . Conclusions : The maximum POMI-CSTN developed by clenching failed to exceed the normally allowed compressive cortical bone strains ; however , additional orthodontic traction force to the OMI may increase POMI-CSTN to compromise OMI stability . Objective : A recent study suggested that rs6504340 , a polymorphism within the homeobox B ( HOXB ) gene cluster , is associated with the susceptibility for malocclusions in Europeans. The resulting malocclusions require orthodontic treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of rs6504340 and other dentition-implicated polymorphisms with dental and occlusal traits in Korean and Japanese populations. Methods : The study participants included 223 unrelated Koreans from the Busan area and 256 unrelated Japanese individuals from the Tokyo metropolitan area. DNA samples were extracted from saliva specimens. Genotyping for rs6504340 and four single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) that have been shown to be associated with the timing of first tooth eruption and the number of teeth at 1 year of age ( rs10506525 , rs1956529 , rs9674544 , and rs8079702 ) was performed using TaqMan assays. The Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need ( IOTN ) , overjet , overbite , arch length discrepancy , crown sizes , and length and width of the dental arches were measured. Spearman 's correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate relationships between rs6504340 and these dental/occlusal traits. Results : We evaluated the aesthetic components and dental health components of the IOTN in the Korean and Japanese populations and found that neither rs6504340 nor the other four SNPs showed any association with dental and occlusal traits in these East Asian populations. Conclusions : These negative results suggest that further research is needed to identify the genetic determinants of malocclusions in order to reach a consensus . Objective : The displacement of the hyoid bone ( HB ) is a critical biomechanical component of the swallowing function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the swallowing-induced vertical and horizontal displacements of the HB in subjects with 2 different magnitudes of skeletal Class III malocclusion , by means of real-time , balanced turbo-field-echo ( B-TFE ) cine-magnetic resonance imaging. Methods : The study population comprised 19 patients with mild skeletal Class III malocclusion , 16 with severe skeletal Class III malocclusion , and 20 with a skeletal Class I relationship. Before the commencement of the study , all subjects underwent cephalometric analysis to identify the nature of skeletal malformations. B-TFE images were obtained for the 4 consecutive stages of deglutition as each patient swallowed 10 mL of water , and the vertical and horizontal displacements of the HB were measured at each stage. Results : At all stages of swallowing , the vertical position of the HB in the severe Class III malocclusion group was significantly lower than those in the mild Class III and Class I malocclusion groups. Similarly , the horizontal displacement of the HB was found to be significantly associated with the severity of malocclusion , i.e. , the degree of Class III malocclusion , while the amount of anterior displacement of the HB decreased with an increase in the severity of the Class III deformity. Conclusions : Our findings indicate the existence of a relationship between the magnitude of Class III malocclusion and HB displacement during swallowing . Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanical and biological properties of orthodontic bonding agents containing silver- or zinc-doped bioactive glass ( BAG ) and determine the antibacterial and remineralization effects of these agents. Methods : BAG was synthesized using the alkali-mediated solgel method. Orthodontic bonding agents containing BAG were prepared by mixing BAG with flowable resin. Transbond XT ( TXT ) and Charmfil Flow ( CF ) were used as controls. Ion release , cytotoxicity , antibacterial properties , the shear bond strength , and the adhesive remnant index were evaluated. To assess the remineralization properties of BAG , micro-computed tomography was performed after pH cycling. Results : The BAG-containing bonding agents showed no noticeable cytotoxicity and suppressed bacterial growth. When these bonding agents were used , demineralization after pH cycling began approximately 200 to 300 µm away from the bracket. On the other hand , when CF and TXT were used , all surfaces that were not covered by the adhesive were demineralized after pH cycling. Conclusions : Our findings suggest that orthodontic bonding agents containing silver- or zinc-doped BAG have stronger antibacterial and remineralization effects compared with conventional orthodontic adhesives ; thus , they are suitable for use in orthodontic practice . Objective : To evaluate and compare the effects of two appliances on the en masse retraction of the anterior teeth anchored by temporary skeletal anchorage devices ( TSADs ) . Methods : The sample comprised 46 nongrowing hyperdivergent adult patients who planned to undergo upper first premolar extraction using lingual retractors. They were divided into three groups , based on the lingual appliance used : the C-lingual retractor ( CLR ) group ( group 1 , n = 16 ) and two antero-posterior lingual retractor ( APLR ) groups ( n = 30 , groups 2 and 3 ) . The APLR group was divided by the posterior tube angulation ; posterior tube parallel to the occlusal plane ( group 2 , n = 15 ) and distally tipped tube ( group 3 , n = 15 ) . A retrospective clinical investigation of the skeletal , dental , and soft tissue relationships was performed using lateral cephalometric radiographs obtained pretreatment and post en masse retraction of the anterior teeth. Results : All groups achieved significant incisor and canine retraction. The upper posterior teeth did not drift significantly during the retraction period. The APLR group had less angulation change in the anterior dentition , compared to the CLR group. By changing the tube angulation in the APLR , the intrusive force significantly increased in the distally tipped tube of group 3 patients and remarkably reduced the occlusal plane angle. Conclusions : Compared to the CLR , the APLR provides better anterior torque control and canine tipping while achieving bodily translation. Furthermore , changing the tube angulation will affect the amount of incisor intrusion , even in patients with similar palatal vault depth , without the need for additional TSADs . Objective : To identify the available evidence on the effects of rapid maxillary expansion ( RME ) with three-dimensional imaging and provide meta-analytic data from studies assessing the outcomes using computed tomography. Methods : Eleven electronic databases were searched , and prospective case series were selected. Two authors screened all titles and abstracts and assessed full texts of the remaining articles. Seventeen case series were included in the quantitative synthesis. Seven outcomes were investigated : nasal cavity width , maxillary basal bone width , alveolar buccal crest width , alveolar palatal crest width , inter-molar crown width , inter-molar root apex width , and buccopalatal molar inclination. The outcomes were investigated at two-time points : postexpansion ( 2-6 weeks ) and post-retention ( 4-8 months ) . Mean differences and 95 % confidence intervals were used to summarize and combine the data. Results : All the investigated outcomes showed significant differences postexpansion ( maxillary basal bone width , +2.46 mm ; nasal cavity width , +1.95 mm ; alveolar buccal crest width , +3.90 mm ; alveolar palatal crest width , +3.09 mm ; intermolar crown width , +5.69 mm ; inter-molar root apex width , +2.85 mm ; and dental tipping , +3.75° ) and post-retention ( maxillary basal bone width , +2.21 mm ; nasal cavity width , +1.55 mm ; alveolar buccal crest width , +3.57 mm ; alveolar palatal crest width , +3.32 mm ; inter-molar crown width , +5.43 mm ; inter-molar root apex width , +4.75 mm ; and dental tipping , 2.22° ) compared to pre-expansion. Conclusions : After RME , skeletal expansion of the nasomaxillary complex was greater in most caudal structures. Maxillary basal bone showed 10 % post-retention relapse. During retention period , uprighting of maxillary molars occurred . Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate whether extension of the custom base is necessary for enhancement of bond strength , by comparing the debonding forces and residual adhesives of 3 different lingual bracket systems. Methods : A total of 42 extracted upper premolars were randomly divided into 3 groups of 14 each for bonding with brackets having ( 1 ) a conventional limited resin custom base ; ( 2 ) an extended gold alloy custom base : Incognito ; and ( 3 ) an extended resin custom base : KommonBase. The bonding area was measured by scanning the bracket bases with a 3-dimensional digital scanner. The debonding force was measured with an Instron universal testing machine , which applied an occlusogingival shear force. Results : The mean debonding forces were 60.83 N ( standard deviation [ SD ] 10.12 ) , 69.29 N ( SD 9.59 ) , and 104.35 N ( SD17.84 ) for the limited resin custom base , extended gold alloy custom base , and extended resin custom base , respectively. The debonding force observed with the extended resin custom base was significantly different from that observed with the other bases. In addition , the adhesive remnant index was significantly higher with the extended gold alloy custom base. Conclusions : All 3 custom-base lingual brackets can withstand occlusal and orthodontic forces. We conclude that effective bonding of lingual brackets can be obtained without extension of the custom base . Objective : We aimed to performin-vitroevaluation to compare 1 ) shear bond strength ( SBS ) , adhesive remnant index ( ARI ) , and color change between self-etched and acid-etched primers ; 2 ) the SBS , ARI and color change between direct and indirect bonding ; and 3 ) the enamel roughness ( ER ) between 12-blade bur and aluminum oxide polisher debonding methods. Methods : Seventy bovine incisors were distributed in seven groups : control ( no bonding ) , direct ( DTBX ) , and 5 indirect bonding ( ITBX , IZ350 , ISONDHI , ISEP , and ITBXp ) . Transbond XT Primer was used in the DTBX , ITBX , and ITBXp groups , flow resin Z350 in the IZ350 group , Sondhi in the ISONDHI group , and SEP primer in the ISEP group. SBS , ARI , and ER were evaluated. The adhesive remnant was removed using a low-speed tungsten bur in all groups except the ITBXp , in which an aluminum oxide polisher was used. After coffee staining , color evaluations were performed using a spectrophotometer immediately after staining and prior to bonding. Results : ISONDHI and ISEP showed significantly lower SBS ( p < 0.01 ) . DTBX had a greater number of teeth with all the adhesive on the enamel ( 70 % ) , compared with the indirect bonding groups ( 0-30 % ) . The ER in the ITBX and ITBXp groups was found to be greater because of both clean-up techniques used. Conclusions : Direct and indirect bonding have similar results and all the primers used show satisfactory adhesion strength. Use of burs and polishers increases the ER , but polishers ensure greater integrity of the initial roughness. Resin tags do not change the color of the teeth . Objective : To examine the effect of bite force on the displacement and stress distribution of orthodontic mini-implants ( OMIs ) in the molar region according to placement site , insertion angle , and loading direction. Methods : Five finite element models were created using micro-computed tomography ( microCT ) images of the maxilla and mandible. OMIs were placed at one maxillary and two mandibular positions : between the maxillary second premolar and first molar , between the mandibular second premolar and first molar , and between the mandibular first and second molars. The OMIs were inserted at angles of 45° and 90° to the buccal surface of the cortical bone. A bite force of 25 kg was applied to the 10 occlusal contact points of the second premolar , first molar , and second molar. The loading directions were 0° , 5° , and 10° to the long axis of the tooth. Results : With regard to placement site , the displacement and stress were greatest for the OMI placed between the mandibular first molar and second molar , and smallest for the OMI placed between the maxillary second premolar and first molar. In the mandibular molar region , the angled OMI showed slightly less displacement than the OMI placed at 90°. The maximum Von Mises stress increased with the inclination of the loading direction. Conclusions : These results suggest that placement of OMIs between the second premolar and first molar at 45° to the cortical bone reduces the effect of bite force on OMIs . Objective : To compare short- and long-term dentoalveolar , skeletal , and rotational changes evaluated by Björk 's structural method of superimposition between children with Class II malocclusion treated by functional appliances and untreated matched controls. Methods : Seventy-nine prepubertal or pubertal children ( mean age , 11.57 ± 1.40 years ) with Class II malocclusion were included. Thirty-four children were treated using an activator with a high-pull headgear ( Z-activator ) , while 28 were treated using an activator without a headgear ( E-activator ) . Seventeen untreated children were included as controls. Lateral cephalograms were obtained before treatment ( T1 ) , after functional appliance treatment ( T2 ) , and after retention in the postpubertal phase ( T3 ) . Changes from T1 to T2 and T1 to T3 were compared between the treated groups and control group using multiple linear regression analysis. Results : Relative to the findings in the control group at T2 , the sagittal jaw relationship ( subspinale-nasion- pogonion , p < 0.001 ) , maxillary prognathism ( sella-nasion-subspinale , p < 0.05 ) , and condylar growth ( p < 0.001 ) exhibited significant improvements in the Z- and E-activator groups , which also showed a significantly increased maxillary incisor retraction ( p < 0.001 ) and decreased overjet ( p < 0.001 ) . Only the E-activator group exhibited significant backward rotation of the maxilla at T2 ( p < 0.01 ) . The improvements in the sagittal jaw relationship ( p < 0.01 ) and dental relationship ( p < 0.001 ) remained significant at T3. Condylar growth and jaw rotations were not significant at T3. Conclusions : Functional appliance treatment in children with Class II malocclusion can significantly improve the sagittal jaw relationship and dental relationships in the long term . Traumatic dental injury is considered a public dental health problem because of a high childhood incidence , high treatment costs , and prolonged treatment time. Although management guidelines for traumatized teeth have been outlined , tooth loss following trauma is occasionally unavoidable. Here , we describe the successful interdisciplinary management of a traumatized central incisor in an 11-year old boy that was extracted because of a poor prognosis and restored by the autotransplantation of an immature donor tooth into the site. The patient underwent orthodontic treatment in order to close the donor site space and bring the autotransplanted tooth to an ideal position. Postorthodontic treatment radiographs and photographs revealed an esthetic and functional natural tooth replacing the lost tooth. The findings from this case suggest that autotransplantation offers unique advantages as a treatment modality for the restoration of missing teeth , particularly in growing children . Objective : To investigate the differences in oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL ) and self-reported jaw function between patients with hyperdivergent and normodivergent facial types. Methods : Eighty patients with a distinctively hyperdivergent facial type ( mandibular plane angle greater than 2 standard deviations , or 42° ) and 80 controls were individually matched according to age , sex , ethnicity , and treatment stage. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires such as the Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP-14 ) and Jaw Functional Limitation Scale ( JFLS-8 ) . Results : The mean age of the patients was 17.2 ± 4.6 years ( range , 12-9 years ) , with most ( 65.0 % ) being female and of New Zealand European origin ( 91.3 % ) . Individuals with hyperdivergent facial types had higher overall and social domain scores on the OHIP-14 ( p < 0.05 ) than did the ones with normodivergent facial types. However , the intergroup differences in JFLS-8 scores were not significant ( p > 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Jaw function appears to be similar in individuals with hyperdivergent and normodivergent facial morphologies. However , those with hyperdivergent facial types are more likely to self-report poorer OHRQoL than are those with normal faces , especially in relation to social aspects . Objective : The coefficients of friction ( COFs ) of aesthetic ceramic and stainless steel brackets used in conjunction with stainless steel archwires were investigated using a modified linear tribometer and special computer software , and the effects of the bracket slot size ( 0.018 inches [ in ] or 0.022 in ) and materials ( ceramic or metal ) on the COF were determined. Methods : Four types of ceramic ( one with a stainless steel slot ) and one conventional stainless steel bracket were tested with two types of archwire sizes : a 0.017 _ 0.025-in wire in the 0.018-in slots and a 0.019 _ 0.025-in wire in the 0.022-in slot brackets. For pairwise comparisons between the 0.018-in and 0.022-in slot sizes in the same bracket , an independent sample t-test was used. One-way and two-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and Tukey 's post-hoc test at the 95 % confidence level ( α = 0.05 ) were also used for statistical analyses. Results : There were significant differences between the 0.022-in and 0.018-in slot sizes for the same brand of bracket. ANOVA also showed that both slot size and bracket slot material had significant effects on COF values ( p < 0.001 ) . The ceramic bracket with a 0.022-in stainless steel slot showed the lowest mean COF ( µ = 0.18 ) , followed by the conventional stainless steel bracket with a 0.022-in slot ( µ = 0.21 ) . The monocrystalline alumina ceramic bracket with a 0.018-in slot had the highest COF ( µ = 0.85 ) . Conclusions : Brackets with stainless steel slots exhibit lower COFs than ceramic slot brackets. All brackets show lower COFs as the slot size increases . Objective : The purpose of this study was to analyze the transverse dental compensation in reference to the maxillary and mandibular basal bones using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) and evaluate the correlations between transverse dental compensation and skeletal asymmetry variables in patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry. Methods : Thirty patients with skeletal Class I ( control group ; 15 men , 15 women ) and 30 patients with skeletal Class III with menton deviation ( asymmetry group ; 16 men , 14 women ) were included. Skeletal and dental measurements were acquired from reconstructed CBCT images using OnDemand3D 1.0 software. All measurements were compared between groups and between the deviated and nondeviated sides of the asymmetry group. Correlation coefficients for the association between skeletal and dental measurements were calculated. Results : Differences in the ramus inclination ( p < 0.001 ) , maxillary canine and first molar inclinations ( p < 0.001 ) , and distances from the canine and first molar cusp tips to the midmaxillary or midmandibular planes ( p < 0.01 ) between the right and left sides were significantly greater in the asymmetry group than in the control group. In the asymmetry group , the ramus inclination difference ( p < 0.05 ) and mandibular canting ( p < 0.05 ) were correlated with the amount of menton deviation. In addition , dental measurements were positively correlated with the amount of menton deviation ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Transverse dental compensation was correlated with the maxillary and mandibular asymmetry patterns. These results would be helpful in understanding the pattern of transverse dental compensation and planning surgical procedure for patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry . Objective : The purposes of this study were to determine the accuracy of crown and root length measurements of premolars using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) and to generate reference CBCT-based data on incisor , canine , and premolar lengths in patients with malocclusions. Methods : Imaging was performed using a CBCT scanner with a 0.292-mm voxel size and 12-bit grayscale. The CBCT-based length measurements were compared with direct measurements of 94 subsequently extracted premolars without metal restorations using the paired t-test. Furthermore , the crown and root lengths of incisors , canines , and premolars in 62 Korean patients with malocclusions were measured using CBCT , and Pearson 's correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the relationship between the crown and root length measurements of each tooth type. Results : The differences between the CBCT-based and direct measurements of the extracted premolars were not significant , with 95 % limits of agreement of -0.90 to 0.90 mm for crown length and -1.23 to 1.18 mm for root length. Weak positive correlations between the crown and root length measurements were observed for the mandibular canine and premolars. Conclusions : The CBCT-based measurements showed a wider range of limits of agreements for root length than for crown length. The CBCT-based data can be used as a reference for evaluating root length and resorption of teeth without metal restorations in patients with malocclusions . Objective : This study compared occlusal contact areas of ideally planned set-up and accomplished final models against the initial in class I and II molar relationships at finishing. Methods : Evaluations were performed for 41 post-orthodontic treatment cases , of which 22 were clinically diagnosed as class I and the remainder were diagnosed as full cusp class II. Class I cases had four first premolars extracted , while class II cases had maxillary first premolars extracted. Occlusal contact areas were measured using a three-dimensional scanner and RapidForm 2004. Independent t-tests were used to validate comparison values between class I and II finishings. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare initial , set up , and final models. Results : Molars from cases in the class I finishing for the set-up model showed significantly greater contact areas than those from class II finishing ( p < 0.05 ) . The final model class I finishing showed significantly larger contact areas for the second molars ( p < 0.05 ) . The first molars of the class I finishing for the final model showed a tendency to have larger contact areas than those of class II finishing , although the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.078 ) . Conclusions : In set-up models , posterior occlusal contact was better in class I than in class II finishing. In final models , class I finishing tended to have larger occlusal contact areas than class II finishing . Objective : This study aimed to evaluate the effect of an intentionally created socket on bone remodeling with orthodontic tooth movement in rabbits. Methods : Eighteen male rabbits weighing 3.8 - 4.25 kg were used. An 8-mm deep and 2-mm wide socket was drilled in the bone 1 mm mesial to the right mandibular first premolar. The left first premolar was extracted to serve as an extraction socket. A traction force of 100 cN was applied to the right first premolar and left second premolar. Sections were obtained at the middle third of the moving tooth for both the drilled and extraction sockets and evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical analyses. The amount of tooth movement and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase ( TRAP ) -positive cell count were compared between the 2 groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results : At week 2 , the distance of tooth movement was significantly higher in the intentional socket group ( p < 0.05 ) than in the extraction socket group. The number of TRAP-positive cells decreased in week 2 but increased in week 3 ( p < 0.05 ) . However , there were no significant differences between the groups. Furthermore , results of transforming growth factor ( TGF ) -β staining revealed no significant differences. Conclusions : The intentional socket group showed greater distance of tooth movement than did the extraction socket group at week 2. Osteoclast counts and results of immunohistochemical analyses suggested elevated bone remodeling in both the groups. Thus , osteotomy may be an effective modality for enhancing tooth movement in orthodontic treatment . Objective : To compare computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing ( CAD/CAM ) customized nitinol retainers with standard stainlesssteel fixed retainers over a 12-month study period. Methods : This randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) was conducted on 62 patients randomly allocated to a control group that received stainless-steel retainers or a test group that received customized CAD/CAM nickel-titanium retainers. Four time points were defined : retainer placement ( T0 ) and 1-month ( T1 ) , 6-month ( T2 ) , and 12-month ( T3 ) follow-up appointments. At each time point , Little 's irregularity index ( LII ) ( primary endpoint ) and dental stability measurements such as intercanine width were recorded in addition to assessment of periodontal parameters. Radiological measurements such as the incisor mandibular plane angle ( IMPA ) were recorded at T0 and T3. Failure events ( wire integrity or debonding ) were assessed at each time point. Results : From T0 to T3 , LII and other dental measurements showed no significant differences between the two groups. The data for periodontal parameters remained stable over the study period , except for the gingival index , which was slightly , but significantly , higher in the test group at T3 ( p= 0.039 ) . The IMPA angle showed no intergroup difference. The two groups showed no significant difference in debonding events. Conclusions : This RCT conducted over a 12-month period demonstrated no significant difference between customized CAD/CAM nickel-titanium lingual retainers and standard stainlesssteel lingual retainers in terms of dental anterior stability and retainer survival. Both retainers eventually appeared to be equally effective in maintaining periodontal health . Objective : To evaluate soft- and hard-tissue changes in the mandibular angle area after the administration of botulinum toxin type A ( BoNT-A ) injection to patients with masseteric hypertrophy by using three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography ( 3D-CBCT ) . Methods : Twenty volunteers were randomly divided into two groups of 10 patients. Patients in group I received a single BoNT-A injection in both masseter muscles , while those in group II received two BoNT-A injections in each masseter muscle , with the second injection being administered 4 months after the first one. In both groups , 3D-CBCT was performed before the first injection and 6 months after the first injection. Results : Masseter muscle thicknesses and cross-sectional areas were significantly reduced in both groups , but the reductions were significantly more substantial in group II than in group I. The intergonial width of the mandibular angle area did not change significantly in either group. However , the bone volume of the mandibular gonial angle area was more significantly reduced in group II than in group I. Conclusions : The repeated administration of BoNT-A injections may induce bone volume changes in the mandibular angle area . Objective : The aims of this study were to evaluate the relationship between the detachment force and bonding resin surface are and to determine the resin bonding surface area that would provide adequate bonding strength with minimum resin volume. Methods : One hundred and sixty human premolars were randomly divided into 4 groups of 40 teeth each. The diameter of the resin surface area in each group was as follows : group 1 , 1.5 mm ; group 2 , 2.5 mm ; group 3 , 3.5 mm ; and group 4 , 4.5 mm. Respond Dead Soft straight ( length 0.0175 inch ) was used to fabricate the retainers , and Transbond XT was used to fix the retainers to the tooth surfaces. A pair of teeth was embedded in acrylic blocks for each specimen. Thus , each group comprised 20 samples. Fixed retainers were bonded to the teeth , and vertical force was applied at the middle of wire. The force was measured using a universal testing machine. Results : The mean value of detachment force was the highest for group 4 ( 102.38 ± 2.92 N ) , followed by group 3 ( 63.54 ± 2.21 N ) , group 2 ( 51.95 ± 1.61 N ) , and group 1 ( 24.14 ± 1.38 N ) . Conclusions : The detachment force of lingual fixed retainers was significantly affected as the area of the resin bonding surface increased. Considering the minimum bonding strength of brackets , a resin bonding surface area with a diameter of 3.5 mm would provide adequate bonding strength . Objective : The purpose of this study was to examine whether orthodontic treatment experience affects the individual 's perception of smile esthetics and to evaluate differences among orthodontically treated laypersons , non-treated laypersons , and dentists by using computerized image alterations. Methods : A photograph of a woman 's smile was digitally altered using a software image editing program. The alterations involved gingival margin height , crown width and length , incisal plane canting , and dental midline of the maxillary anterior teeth. Three groups of raters ( orthodontically treated laypersons , non-treated laypersons , and dentists ) evaluated the original and altered images using a visual analog scale. Results : The threshold for detecting changes in maxillary central incisor gingival margin height among laypersons was 1.5 mm ; the threshold of dentists , who were more perceptive , was 1.0 mm. For maxillary lateral incisor crown width and height , the threshold of all three groups was 3.0 mm. Canting of the incisal plane was perceived when the canting was 3.0 mm among non-treated laypersons , 2.0 mm among treated laypersons , and 1.0 mm among dentists. Non-treated laypersons could not perceive dental midline shifts ; however , treated laypersons and dentists perceived them when the shift was 3.0 mm. Conclusions : Laypersons with and without orthodontic treatment experience and dentists have different perceptions of smile esthetics. Orthodontically treated laypersons were more critical than non-treated laypersons regarding incisal plane canting and dental midline shifts. Based on these findings , it is suggested that orthodontic treatment experience improved the esthetic perceptions of laypersons . Objective : To evaluate the short-term effect of fangchinoline , an antiinflammatory drug widely used in Asia , on root resorption that is associated with orthodontic tooth movement. Methods : Twenty-four Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups. Mesial forces of 0 , 50 , or 100 g were applied to the maxillary first molar of the rats in each group for 14 days by activating nickel-titanium closed-coil springs. One-half of the rats receiving each of these treatments also received injections of 200 µL fangchinoline every 2 days. Finally , movement of the maxillary first molars was measured using digitized radiographs. The molars were extracted and the surfaces of the root resorption craters were recorded using a scanning electron microscope. The distance the molars moved and resorptionarea ratio was measured , and results were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA tests. Results : There were no statistical differences in the distances the first molars moved under 50 or 100 g force , regardless of treatment with fangchinoline. However , the resorption area ratios were significantly smaller in those rats that were treated with both tension and fangchinoline than in those rats treated by tension alone. Conclusions : Fangchinoline reduced the resorption area ratio in rats and is therefore an important means of alleviating root resorption . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of Reference Ear Plug ( REP ) during cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) scan for the generation of lateral cephalograms from CBCT scan data. Methods : Two CBCT scans were obtained from 33 adults. One CBCT scan was acquired using conventional methods , and the other scan was acquired with the use of REP. Virtual lateral cephalograms created from each CBCT image were traced and compared with tracings of the real cephalograms obtained from the same subject. Results : CBCT scan with REP resulted in a smaller discrepancy between real and virtual cephalograms. In comparing the real and virtual cephalograms , no measurements significantly differed from real cephalogram values in case of CBCT scan with REP , whereas many measurements significantly differed in the case of CBCT scan without REP. Conclusion : Measurements from CBCT-generated cephalograms are more similar to those from real cephalograms when REP are used during CBCT scan. Thus , the use of REP is suggested during CBCT scan to generate accurate virtual cephalograms from CBCT scan data . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of malocclusion or orthodontic treatment on oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL ) in adults. Methods : The sample consisted of 860 adults ( 378 men and 482 women , aged 18-39 years ) who were clinically evaluated for malocclusion or orthodontic treatment experience. Participants were divided into 4 groups as follows : normal occlusion , malocclusion , fixed treatment , and retention. OHRQoL was assessed with the short form of the Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP-14 ) and Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire ( PIDAQ ) . Results : The malocclusion group and the fixed treatment group had significantly higher OHIP-14 scores than the normal occlusion group and the retention group ( p < 0.001 ) . The malocclusion group had the highest PIDAQ score , while the normal occlusion group and the retention group had the lowest PIDAQ score ( p < 0.001 ) . Women had higher OHIP-14 and PIDAQ scores than men. A significant positive correlation was found between OHIP-14 and PIDAQ scores ( p < 0.01 ) . Conclusions : Malocclusion has a negative impact on OHRQoL , but this could be improved in adults through orthodontic treatment. These OHRQoL questionnaires can provide additional useful information on specific aspects of orthodontic patients ' psychological state . Objective : To determine the changes in dental anxiety , state anxiety , and trait anxiety levels of patients and their parents after 3 months of active orthodontic treatment. Methods : We evaluated 120 patients and one parent of each patient. State Anxiety ( STAI-S ) , Trait Anxiety ( STAI-T ) , and Corah 's Dental Anxiety Scale ( DAS ) were administered before orthodontic treatment ( T1 ) and after 3 months of treatment ( T2 ) . Differences in scores between T1 and T2 were compared using paired-sample t-tests and the relationship between the scores of the DAS and the STAI were analyzed using a bivariate two-tailed Pearson correlation test. Results : Dental anxiety and state anxiety levels decreased among the patients after adjustment to orthodontic treatment ( p < 0.001 ) . However , 3 months of treatment was not sufficient to decrease the anxiety levels of parents ( p > 0.05 ) . Patient trait anxiety affected patient state anxiety and dental anxiety ( p < 0.01 ) . Additionally , a significant correlation was found between patient dental anxiety and parent dental anxiety ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Dental anxiety and state anxiety levels decrease after patients become familiar with their orthodontist and they became accustomed to orthodontic treatment. However , 3 months is not a sufficient length of time to decrease parental anxiety levels . Objective : The aim of this study was to analyze tooth movement and arch width changes in maxillary dentition following nonextraction treatment with orthodontic mini-implant ( OMI ) anchorage in Class II division 1 malocclusions. Methods : Seventeen adult patients diagnosed with Angle 's Class II division 1 malocclusion were treated by nonextraction with OMIs as anchorage for distalization of whole maxillary dentition. Three-dimensional virtual maxillary models were superimposed with the best-fit method at the pretreatment and post-treatment stages. Linear , angular , and arch width variables were measured using Rapidform 2006 software , and analyzed by the paired t-test. Results : All maxillary teeth showed statistically significant movement posteriorly ( p < 0.05 ) . There were no significant changes in the vertical position of the maxillary teeth , except that the second molars were extruded ( 0.86 mm , p < 0.01 ) . The maxillary first and second molars were rotated distal-in ( 4.5° , p < 0.001 ; 3.0° , p < 0.05 , respectively ) . The intersecond molar width increased slightly ( 0.1 mm , p > 0.05 ) and the intercanine , interfirst premolar , intersecond premolar , and interfirst molar widths increased significantly ( 2.2 mm , p < 0.01 ; 2.2 mm , p < 0.05 ; 1.9 mm , p < 0.01 ; 2.0 mm , p < 0.01 ; respectively ) . Conclusions : Nonextraction treatment with OMI anchorage for Class II division 1 malocclusions could retract the whole maxillary dentition to achieve a Class I canine and molar relationship without a change in the vertical position of the teeth ; however , the second molars were significantly extruded. Simultaneously , the maxillary arch was shown to be expanded with distal-in rotation of the molars . Objective : To evaluate the changes in cortical bone thickness , alveolar bone height , and the incidence of dehiscence and fenestration in the surrounding alveolar bone of posterior teeth after rapid maxillary expansion ( RME ) treatment using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) . Methods : The CBCT records of 20 subjects ( 9 boys , mean age : 13.97 ± 1.17 years ; 11 girls , mean age : 13.53 ± 2.12 year ) that underwent RME were selected from the archives. CBCT scans had been taken before ( T1 ) and after ( T2 ) the RME. Moreover , 10 of the subjects had 6-month retention ( T3 ) records. We used the CBCT data to evaluate the buccal and palatal aspects of the canines , first and second premolars , and the first molars at 3 vertical levels. The cortical bone thickness and alveolar bone height at T1 and T2 were evaluated with the paired-samples t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Repeated measure ANOVA or the Friedman test was used to evaluate the statistical significance at T1 , T2 , and T3. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results : The buccal cortical bone thickness decreased gradually from baseline to the end of the retention period. After expansion , the buccal alveolar bone height was reduced significantly ; however , this change was not statistically significant after the 6-month retention period. During the course of the treatment , the incidence of dehiscence and fenestration increased and decreased , respectively. Conclusions : RME may have detrimental effects on the supporting alveolar bone , since the thickness and height of the buccal alveolar bone decreased during the retention period . Objective : To study and compare the effects of different demineralization-inhibition methods on the shear bond strength ( SBS ) and fracture mode of an adhesive used to bond orthodontic brackets to demineralized enamel surfaces. Methods : Eighty freshly extracted , human maxillary premolars were divided into 4 equal groups and demineralized over the course of 21 days. Brackets were bonded to the demineralized enamel of teeth in Group 1. In Group 2 , bonding was performed following resin infiltration ( ICON® , DMG , Hamburg , Germany ) . Before bonding , pre-treatment with acidulated phosphate fluoride ( APF ) or solutions containing casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate with 2 % neutral sodium fluoride ( CPP-ACP/wF ) was performed in Groups 3 and 4 , respectively. The SBS values of the brackets were measured and recorded following mechanical shearing of the bracket from the tooth surface. The adhesive remnant index ( ARI ) scores were determined after the brackets failed. Statistical comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA , Tukey 's post-tests , and G-tests. Results : Significant differences were found in some of the intergroup comparisons of the SBS values ( F = 39.287 , p < 0.001 ) . No significant differences were found between the values for the APF-gel and control groups , whereas significantly higher SBS values were recorded for the resin-infiltrated and CPP-ACP/wF-treated groups. The ARI scores were also significantly different among the 4 groups ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : Tooth surfaces exposed to resin infiltration and CPP-ACP/wF application showed higher debonding forces than the untreated , demineralized surfaces . Cleidocranial dysplasia ( CCD ) , an autosomal dominant disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 1,000,000 individuals , is mainly caused by mutations in Runx2 , a gene required for osteoblastic differentiation. It is generally characterized by hypoplastic clavicles , narrow thorax , and delayed or absent fontanel closure. Importantly , its orofacial manifestations , including midfacial hypoplasia , retained primary teeth , and impacted permanent and supernumerary teeth , severely impede the well-being of affected individuals. Successful treatment of the orofacial problems requires the combined efforts of dental specialists. However , only a few successfully treated cases have been reported because of the rarity of CCD and complexity of the treatment. This article presents the University of California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) treatment protocol for the dentofacial manifestations of CCD based on two treated and 17 diagnosed cases. The records of two patients with CCD who had been treated at the UCSF School of Dentistry and the treatment options reported in the literature were reviewed. The UCSF treatment protocol produced a successful case and a partially successful one ( inadequate oral hygiene in the retention stage resulted in decay and loss of teeth ) . It provides general guidelines for successfully treating the orofacial manifestations of CCD . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate ( CPP-ACP ) on the shear bond strength ( SBS ) of brackets bonded to non-demineralized teeth with either phosphoric acid etching or self-etching primer. Methods : Sixty human premolars were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups ( n = 15 each ) : phosphoric acid etching ( group 1 ) ; self-etching primer ( group 2 ) ; CPP-ACP for 2 weeks + phosphoric acid etching ( group 3 ) , and CPP-ACP for 2 weeks + self-etching primer ( group 4 ) . After bonding of the maxillary premolar metal brackets , specimens were subjected to shear forces in a testing machine. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe etching patterns on the enamel surfaces of all teeth. A 2-way analysis of variance was used to test for effects of CPP-ACP and etching system on SBS. Results : Significantly higher mean SBSs were observed in groups subjected to phosphoric acid etching ( i.e. , groups 1 and 3 ; p < 0.05 ) . On the other hand , SBSs did not appear to be influenced by CPP-ACP ( i.e. , groups 3 and 4 ; p > 0.05 ) . We observed a uniform and clear etched pattern on the enamel surface of the phosphoric acid etching groups. Conclusions : CPP-ACP does not significantly affect the SBS of orthodontic brackets bonded to non-demineralized teeth , regardless of which adhesive method is used to bond the brackets . Objective : To examine the prophylactic potential of 3 orthodontic bonding adhesives : Fuji Ortho SC , Illuminate , and Resilience. Methods : Thirty-six Wistar Wag rats were randomly divided into 4 groups consisting of 9 rats each. One of the groups received no treatment and was used as a control. In the other groups , individual bands coated with one of the 3 adhesives were cemented to the lower incisors. Enamel samples were obtained after 6 and 12 weeks and analyzed using scanning electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive spectrometry. Results : Six weeks after band cementation , no fluoride was found in the enamel of the lower incisors. After 12 weeks , there was no fluoride in the enamel of teeth coated with the Resilience composite. However , in the case of the Illuminate composite and the resin-modified glass ionomer Fuji Ortho SC cement , the depth of fluoride penetration reached 2 µm and 4.8 - 5.7 µm , respectively. Conclusions : Fluoride ions from orthodontic adhesives can be incorporated into the surface layer of the enamel. Orthodontists may apply orthodontic adhesives , such as the Fuji Ortho SC , to reduce the occurrence of caries during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances . Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a newly developed rapid maxillary expansion screw-the memory screw-over 6 months. Methods : Five subjects , aged between 11.7 and 13.75 years , were enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent placement of a maxillary expansion appliance containing superelastic nickel-titanium open-coil springs in its screw bed. The parents of the patients and/or the patients themselves were instructed to activate the expansion screw by 2 quarter-turns 3 times a day ( morning , midday , and evening ; 6 quarter-turns a day ) . The mean expansion period was 7.52 ± 1.04 days. Dentoskeletal effects of the procedure , including dentoalveolar inclination , were evaluated. Measurements of all the parameters were repeated after 6 months of retention in order to check for relapse. Results : Sella-Nasion-A point ( SNA ) and Sella-Nasion/Gonion-Menton angles increased , and Sella-Nasion-B point ( SNB ) angle decreased in all the subjects during the expansion phase. However , they approximated to the initial values at the end of 6 months. On the other hand , the increments in maxillary apical base ( Mxr-Mxl ) and intermolar widths was quite stable. As expected , some amount of dentoalveolar tipping was observed. Conclusions : The newly developed memory expansion screw offers advantages of both rapid and slow expansion procedures. It widens the midpalatal suture and expands the maxilla with relatively lighter forces and within a short time. In addition , the resultant increments in the maxillary apical base and intermolar width remained quite stable even after 6 months of retention . Root resorption can be caused by several factors , including contact with the cortical bone. Here we report a case involving a 21-year-old female with Angle Class II , division 1 malocclusion who exhibited significant root resorption in the maxillary right central incisor after orthodontic treatment. The patient presented with significant left-sided deviation of the maxillary incisors due to lingual dislocation of the left lateral incisor and a Class II molar relationship. Cephalometric analysis demonstrated a Class I skeletal relationship ( A pointnasion-B point , 2.5° ) and proclined maxillary anterior teeth ( upper incisor to sella-nasion plane angle , 113.4° ) . The primary treatment objectives were the achievement of stable occlusion with midline agreement between the maxillary and mandibular dentitions and appropriate maxillary anterior tooth axes and molar relationship. A panoramic radiograph obtained after active treatment showed significant root resorption in the maxillary right central incisor ; therefore , we performed cone-beam computed tomography , which confirmed root resorption along the cortical bone around the incisive canal. The findings from this case , where different degrees of root resorption were observed despite comparable degrees of orthodontic movement in the bilateral maxillary central incisors , suggest that the incisive canal could be an inducing factor for root resorption. However , further investigation is necessary to confirm this assumption . Objective : The purposes of this study were to measure the palatal soft tissue thickness at popular placement sites of temporary anchorage devices ( TADs ) by cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) and evaluate the age , gender , and positional differences in this parameter. Methods : The study sample consisted of 23 children ( 10 boys and 13 girls ; mean age , 10.87 ± 1.24 years ; range , 6.7 to 12.6 years ) and 27 adults ( 14 men and 13 women ; mean age , 21.35 ± 1.14 years ; range , 20.0 to 23.8 years ) . Nine mediolateral and nine anteroposterior intersecting reference lines were drawn on CBCT scans of the 50 subjects , and the resultant measurement areas were designated according to their mediolateral ( i.e. , lateral , medial , and sutural ) and anteroposterior ( i.e. , anterior , middle , and posterior ) positions. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to analyze intragroup and intergroup differences. Results : No significant age and gender differences were found ( p = 0.309 and 0.124 , respectively ) . Further , no significant anteroposterior change was observed ( p = 0.350 ) . However , the lateral area presented the thickest soft tissue whereas the sutural area had the thinnest soft tissue ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : Clinical selection of the placement sites of TADs should be guided by knowledge of the positional variations in the palatal soft tissue thickness in addition to other contributing factors of TAD stability . Objective : The purpose of this study was to examine the symmetry and parallelism of the skeletal and soft-tissue poria by three-dimensional ( 3D ) computed tomographic ( CT ) imaging. Methods : The locations of the bilateral skeletal and soft-tissue poria in 29 patients with facial asymmetry ( asymmetric group ) and 29 patients without facial asymmetry ( symmetric group ) were measured in 3D reconstructed models of CT images by using a 3D coordinate system. The mean intergroup differences in the anteroposterior and vertical angular deviations of the poria and their anteroposterior and vertical parallelism were statistically analyzed. Results : The symmetric and asymmetric groups showed significant anteroposterior angular differences in both the skeletal and the soft-tissue poria ( p = 0.007 and 0.037 , respectively ; Mann-Whitney U-test ) . No significant differences in the anteroposterior and vertical parallelism of the poria were noted ( p 0.05 ; Wilcoxon signed-rank test ) . Conclusions : In general , the skeletal poria are parallel to the soft-tissue poria. However , patients with facial asymmetry tend to have asymmetric poria . Objective : This study aimed to assess three-dimensional changes in the temporomandibular joint positions and mandibular dimensions after correction of dental factors restricting mandibular growth in patients with Class II division 1 or division 2 malocclusion in the pubertal growth period. Methods : This prospective clinical study included 14 patients each with Class II division 1 ( group I ) and Class II division 2 ( group II ) malocclusions. The quad-helix was used for maxillary expansion , while utility arches were used for intrusion ( group I ) or protrusion and intrusion ( group II ) of the maxillary incisors. After approximately 2 months of treatment , an adequate maxillary arch width and acceptable maxillary incisor inclination were obtained. The patients were followed for an average of 6 months. Intraoral and extraoral photographs , plaster models , and cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images were obtained before and after treatment. Lateral cephalometric and temporomandibular joint measurements were made from the CBCT images. Results : The mandibular dimensions increased in both groups , although mandibular positional changes were also found in group II. There were no differences in the condylar position within the mandibular fossa or the condylar dimensions. The mandibular fossa depth and condylar positions were symmetrical at treatment initiation and completion. Conclusions : Class II malocclusion can be partially corrected by achieving an ideal maxillary arch form , particularly in patients with Class II division 2 malocclusion. Restrictions of the mandible in the transverse or sagittal plane do not affect the temporomandibular joint positions in these patients because of the high adaptability of this joint . In the present report , we describe the successful use of miniscrews to achieve vertical control in combination with the conventional sliding MBT straight-wire technique for the treatment of a 26-year-old Chinese woman with a very high mandibular plane angle , deep overbite , retrognathic mandible with backward rotation , prognathic maxilla , and gummy smile. The patient exhibited skeletal Class II malocclusion. Orthodontic miniscrews were placed in the maxillary anterior and posterior segments to provide rigid anchorage and vertical control through intrusion of the incisors and molars. Intrusion and torque control of the maxillary incisors relieved the deep overbite and corrected the gummy smile , while intrusion of the maxillary molars aided in counterclockwise rotation of the mandibular plane , which consequently resulted in an improved facial profile. After 3.5 years of retention , we observed a stable , well-aligned dentition with ideal intercuspation and more harmonious facial contours. Thus , we were able to achieve a satisfactory occlusion , a significantly improved facial profile , and an attractive smile for this patient. The findings from this case suggest that nonsurgical correction using miniscrew anchorage is an effective approach for camouflage treatment of high-angle cases with skeletal Class II malocclusion . We report a case involving a young female patient with severe mandibular retrognathism accompanied by mandibular condylar deformity that was effectively treated with Le Fort I osteotomy and two genioplasty procedures. At 9 years and 9 months of age , she was diagnosed with Angle Class III malocclusion , a skeletal Class II jaw relationship , an anterior crossbite , congenital absence of some teeth , and a left-sided cleft lip and palate. Although the anterior crossbite and narrow maxillary arch were corrected by interceptive orthodontic treatment , severe mandibular hypogrowth resulted in unexpectedly severe mandibular retrognathism after growth completion. Moreover , bilateral condylar deformities were observed , and we suspected progressive condylar resorption ( PCR ) . There was a high risk of further condylar resorption with mandibular advancement surgery ; therefore , Le Fort I osteotomy with two genioplasty procedures was performed to achieve counterclockwise rotation of the mandible and avoid ingravescence of the condylar deformities. The total duration of active treatment was 42 months. The maxilla was impacted by 7.0 mm and 5.0 mm in the incisor and molar regions , respectively , while the pogonion was advanced by 18.0 mm. This significantly resolved both skeletal disharmony and malocclusion. Furthermore , the hyoid bone was advanced , the pharyngeal airway space was increased , and the morphology of the mandibular condyle was maintained. At the 30-month follow-up examination , the patient exhibited a satisfactory facial profile. The findings from our case suggest that severe mandibular retrognathism with condylar deformities can be effectively treated without surgical mandibular advancement , thus decreasing the risk of PCR . Objective : To investigate the stem cell-like characteristics of human periodontal ligament ( PDL ) stromal cells outgrown from orthodontically extracted premolars and to evaluate the potential for myogenic differentiation. Methods : PDL stromal cells were obtained from extracted premolars by using the outgrowth method. Cell morphological features , self-replication capability , and the presence of cell-surface markers , along with osteogenic , adipogenic , and chondrogenic differentiation , were confirmed. In addition , myogenic differentiation was induced by the use of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5-Aza ) for DNA demethylation. Results : PDL stromal cells showed growth patterns and morphological features similar to those of fibroblasts. In contrast , the proliferation rates of premolar PDL stromal cells were similar to those of bone marrow and adipogenic stem cells. PDL stromal cells expressed surface markers of human mesenchymal stem cells ( i.e. , CD90 and CD105 ) , but not those of hematopoietic stem cells ( i.e. , CD31 and CD34 ) . PDL stromal cells were differentiated into osteogenic , adipogenic , and chondrogenic lineages. Myotube structures were induced in PDL stromal cells after 5-Aza pretreatment , but not in the absence of 5-Aza pretreatment. Conclusions : PDL stromal cells isolated from extracted premolars can potentially be a good source of postnatal stem cells for oromaxillofacial regeneration in bone and muscle . Objective : To test the null hypothesis that no difference exists between the effects of at-home bleaching and in-office bleaching on shear bond strength ( SBS ) with bracket bonding at 4 different time intervals after dental bleaching. Methods : Ninety extracted human premolars were randomly divided into 9 groups ( n = 10 ) according to the bleaching methods used ( at-home bleaching and in-office bleaching ) and the storage time in artificial saliva ( 30 min , 1 day , 2 weeks , and 3 weeks before bonding ) . The control group was stored in artificial saliva for 7 days. Brackets were bonded with the Transbond XT adhesive system , and SBS testing was performed. The adhesive remnant index ( ARI ) was used to assess the amount of resin remaining on the enamel surfaces after debonding. The SBS data were analyzed by analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and the Tukey test. For the ARI , the Kruskal-Wallis test was performed. Significance for all statistical tests was predetermined to be p < 0.05. Results : The SBS of the unbleached group was significantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) than that of the bleached groups ( except for the group bonded 30 min after at-home bleaching ) . Conclusions : The null hypothesis was not totally rejected. All bleaching groups tested had decreased SBS of the brackets to the enamel , except for the group bonded 30 min after at-home bleaching. The SBS returned to values close to those of the unbleached enamel within 3 weeks following bleaching . Objective : The aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to compare oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQoL ) of patients treated with conventional , active self-ligating ( ASL ) , and passive self-ligating ( PSL ) brackets in different therapeutic phases. Methods : Sixty patients ( mean age 18.3 years ; 29 males and 31 females ) requiring orthodontic treatment were randomly and equally assigned to receive conventional ( Victory Series ) , ASL ( In-Ovation R ) , or PSL ( Damon 3MX ) brackets. OHRQoL was measured with a self-administered modified 16-item Malaysian version of the Oral Health Impact Profile for immediate ( soon after the visit ) and late ( just before the subsequent visit ) assessments of the bonding and activation phases. Data were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests. Results : The PSL and ASL groups showed more immediate and late impacts in the bonding phase , respectively ; the conventional group was affected in both the assessments. The first activation phase had similar impacts in the groups. After the second activation , the conventional group showed more immediate impacts , whereas the PSL and ASL groups had more late impacts. The commonly affected domains were `` physical disability , '' `` functional limitation , '' `` physical pain , '' and `` psychological discomfort. '' No significant differences in the prevalence and severity of immediate and late impacts on OHRQoL of the patients were noted in any therapeutic phase. Conclusions : No bracket system seems to ensure superior OHRQoL. This information could be useful for explaining the therapeutic phases , especially the initial one , and selecting the optimal bracket system based on the patient 's preference . Objective : To evaluate the long-term effects of self-ligating brackets ( SLBs ) on transverse dimensions of arches and skeletal and soft tissues and to quantitatively evaluate the treatment outcome after non-extraction treatment with SLBs. Methods : The sample consisted of 24 ( 18 female and six male ) subjects , with a mean age of 14.23 ± 2.19 years , who received treatment with the Damon®3 appliances. Complete records including cephalometric radiographs and plaster models were obtained before treatment ( T1 ) , immediately after treatment ( T2 ) , six months after treatment ( T3 ) , and two years ( T4 ) after treatment. Digital study models were generated. Twenty lateral cephalometric , six frontal cephalometric , and eight dental cast measurements were examined. The Peer Assessment Rating index was used to measure the treatment outcome. The Wilcoxon test was applied for statistical analysis of the changes. Results : There were significant increases in all transverse dental cast measurements with active treatment. There was some significant relapse in the long term , particularly in maxillary width ( p < 0.05 ) . Statistically significant increases were found in nasal ( p < 0.001 ) , maxillary base , upper molar , lower intercanine , and antigonial ( p < 0.05 ) widths in T1-T2. Lower incisors were proclined and protruded in T1-T2. Conclusions : SLBs correct crowding by mechanisms involving incisor proclination and protrusion and expansion of the dental arches , without induction of clinically significant changes in hard and soft tissues of the face . Objective : The aim of this study was to compare the success rates of the manual and motor-driven mini-screw insertion methods according to age , gender , length of mini-screws , and insertion sites. Methods : We retrospectively reviewed 429 orthodontic mini-screw placements in 286 patients ( 102 in men and 327 in women ) between 2005 and 2010 at private practice. Age , gender , mini-screw length , and insertion site were cross-tabulated against the insertion methods. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was performed to compare the success rates of the 2 insertion methods. Results : The motor-driven method was used for 228 mini-screws and the manual method for the remaining 201 mini-screws. The success rates were similar in both men and women irrespective of the insertion method used. With respect to mini-screw length , no difference in success rates was found between motor and hand drivers for the 6-mm-long mini-screws ( 68.1 % and 69.5 % with the engine driver and hand driver , respectively ) . However , the 8-mm-long mini-screws exhibited significantly higher success rates ( 90.4 % , p < 0.01 ) than did the 6-mm-long mini-screws when placed with the engine driver. The overall success rate was also significantly higher in the maxilla ( p < 0.05 ) when the engine driver was used. Success rates were similar among all age groups regardless of the insertion method used. Conclusions : Taken together , the motor-driven insertion method can be helpful to get a higher success rate of orthodontic mini-screw placement . Objective : The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the postoperative three-dimensional ( 3D ) changes in the proximal segments after mandibular setback sagittal split ramus osteotomy and to compare the changes between the conventional mini-plate fixation and semi-rigid sliding plate fixation. Methods : Cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images were used to evaluate the postoperative 3D changes in the proximal segments during the healing process. CBCT images were superimposed using the symphysis and the lower anterior mandible as references. Results : There were no statistically significant differences between the conventional mini-plate and semi-rigid sliding plate groups ( p > 0.05 ) . With respect to the distribution of changes greater than 2 mm in the landmarks , the right condylion , right coronoid process , and left condylion showed ratios of 55.6 % , 50.0 % , and 44.4 % , respectively , in the semi-rigid sliding plate group ; however , none of the landmarks showed ratios greater than 30 % in the conventional mini-plate group. Conclusions : There were no statistically significant differences in postoperative changes in the segments between the conventional mini-plate and semi-rigid sliding plate groups. Nevertheless , while selecting the type of fixation technique , clinicians should consider that landmarks with greater than 2 mm changes were higher in the semi-rigid sliding plate group than in the conventional mini-plate group . Objective : To three-dimensionally elucidate the effects of occlusal hypofunction on the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone proper of rat molars by micro-computed tomography ( micro-CT ) . Methods : Occlusal function in the molar area was restricted by attaching an anterior bite plate on the maxillary incisors and a metal cap on the mandibular incisors of 5-week-old male Wistar rats for 1 week. The periodontal ligament space and alveolar bone proper around roots of the mandibular first molar were assessed by histology and micro-CT. Results : The periodontal ligament space was narrower and the alveolar bone proper was sparser and less continuous in the hypofunction group than in the control group. Further , both the volume of the periodontal ligament and the volumetric ratio of the alveolar bone proper to the total tissue in the region of interest were significantly lower in the hypofunction group ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Occlusal hypofunction induces atrophic changes in the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone proper of rat molars . Objective : To assess the accuracy of anterior tooth movement using clear aligners in integrated three-dimensional digital models. Methods : Cone-beam computed tomography was performed before and after treatment with clear aligners in 32 patients. Plaster casts were laser-scanned for virtual setup and aligner fabrication. Differences in predicted and achieved root and crown positions of anterior teeth were compared on superimposed maxillofacial digital images and virtual models and analyzed by Student 's t-test. Results : The mean discrepancies in maxillary and mandibular crown positions were 0.376 ± 0.041 mm and 0.398 ± 0.037 mm , respectively. Maxillary and mandibular root positions differed by 2.062 ± 0.128 mm and 1.941 ± 0.154 mm , respectively. Conclusions : Crowns but not roots of anterior teeth can be moved to designated positions using clear aligners , because these appliances cause tooth movement by tilting motion . Objective : To determine the interleukin ( IL ) -6 levels in gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) of patients with severe root resorption after orthodontic treatment and investigate the effects of different static compressive forces ( CFs ) on IL-6 production by human periodontal ligament ( hPDL ) cells and the influence of IL-6 on osteoclastic activation from human osteoclastic precursor ( hOCP ) cells in vitro. Methods : IL-6 levels in GCF samples collected from 20 patients ( 15 and 5 subjects without and with radiographic evidence of severe root resorption , respectively ) who had undergone orthodontic treatment were measured by ELISA. The levels of IL-6 mRNA in hPDL cells and IL-6 protein in conditioned medium after the application of different uniform CFs ( 0 , 1.0 , 2.0 , or 4.0 g/cm ( 2 ) for up to 72 h ) were measured by real-time PCR and ELISA , respectively. Finally , the influence of IL-6 on mature osteoclasts was investigated by using hOCP cells on dentin slices in a pit-formation assay. Results : Clinically , the IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the resorption group than in the control group. In vitro , IL-6 mRNA expression significantly increased with increasing CF. IL-6 protein secretion also increased in a time- and magnitude-dependent manner. Resorbed areas on dentin slices were significantly greater in the recombinant human IL-6-treated group and group cultured in hPDL cell-conditioned medium with CF application ( 4.0 g/cm ( 2 ) ) than in the group cultured in hPDL cell-conditioned medium without CF application. Conclusions : IL-6 may play an important role in inducing or facilitating orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption . Objective : To assess the prevalence of malocclusion and its relationship with dental caries among school children in southern India. Methods : This cross-sectional study included 1,800 students aged 11 - 15 years whose Dental Aesthetic Index ( DAI ) and dentition status were recorded and analyzed. The chi-square test , ANOVA , and Spearman 's correlation tests were carried out. Results : The mean DAI score ± the standard deviation was 18.61 ± 6.1. Approximately 85 % of the students ( 83.0 % males , 86.8 % females ) had DAI scores of < 26 and were classified as not requiring orthodontic treatment. One tenth of the sample had mean DAI scores between 26 - 30 ( indicating definite malocclusion and elective treatment ) , while about 3 % had mean scores between 31 - 35 ( indicating severe malocclusion and treatment desirability ) . Only 29 children ( 1.6 % ; 16 boys , 13 girls ) had a DAI score of > 35 , which suggested very severe or handicapping malocclusion requiring mandatory treatment. The mean decayed , missing , filled teeth ( DMFT ) was 2.28 ± 1.47. A DMFT of > 0 was observed in 91.8 % of the study subjects. Children with a DAI score of > 35 were found to have significantly ( p < 0.001 ) higher caries experience as compared to other children. Moreover , the DAI scores showed a significant correlation with the mean DMFT scores ( r = 0.368 , p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : A positive correlation was found between the severity of malocclusion and dental caries . Objective : Bonding forces of brackets to enamel surfaces may be affected by the procedures used for bleaching and enamel etching. The aim of this study was to investigate the bonding strength of orthodontic brackets to laser-etched surfaces of bleached teeth. Methods : In a nonbleached control group , acid etching ( group A ) or Er : YAG laser application ( group B ) was performed prior to bracket bonding ( n = 13 in each group ) . Similar surface treatments were performed at 1 day ( groups C and D ; n = 13 in each subgroup ) or at 3 weeks ( groups E and F ; n = 13 in each subgroup ) after 38 % hydrogen peroxide bleaching in another set of teeth. The specimens were debonded after thermocycling. Results : Laser etching of bleached teeth resulted in clinically unacceptable low bonding strength. In the case of acid-etched teeth , waiting for 3 weeks before attachment of brackets to the bleached surfaces resulted in similar , but not identical , bond strength values as those obtained with nonbleached surfaces. However , in the laser-etched groups , the bonding strength after 3 weeks was the same as that for the nonbleached group. Conclusions : When teeth bleached with 38 % hydrogen peroxide are meant to be bonded immediately , acid etching is preferable . Objective : This study examined cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) -derived multiplanar-reconstructed ( MPR ) cross-sections to clarify the salient characteristics of patients with skeletal class III malocclusion with midface deficiency ( MD ) . Methods : The horizontal and sagittal plane intersection points were identified for middle-third facial analysis in 40 patients in the MD or normal ( N ) groups. MPR images acquired parallel to each horizontal plane were used for length and angular measurements. Results : A comparison of the MD and N groups revealed significant differences in the zygoma prominence among female patients. The convex zygomatic area in the N group was larger than that in the MD group , and the inferior part of the midface in the N group was smaller than that in the MD group for both male and female patients. A significant difference was observed in the concave middle maxillary area among male patients. Conclusions : This study was conducted to demonstrate the difference between MD and normal face through MPR images derived from CBCT. Male patients in the MD group had a more flattened face than did those in the N group. Female patients in the MD group showed a concave-shaped lower section of the zygoma , which tended to have more severe MD. These findings indicate that orthognathic surgery to improve skeletal discrepancy requires different approaches in male and female patients . Objective : To investigate the involvement of ephrinB2 in periodontal tissue remodeling in compression areas during orthodontic tooth movement and the effects of compressive force on EphB4 and ephrinB2 expression in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Methods : A rat model of experimental tooth movement was established to examine the histological changes and the localization of ephrinB2 in compressed periodontal tissues during experimental tooth movement. RAW264.7 cells and ST2 cells , used as precursor cells of osteoclasts and osteoblasts , respectively , were subjected to compressive force in vitro. The gene expression of EphB4 and ephrinB2 , as well as bone-associated factors including Runx2 , Sp7 , NFATc1 , and calcitonin receptor , were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Results : Histological examination of the compression areas of alveolar bone from experimental rats showed that osteoclastogenic activities were promoted while osteogenic activities were inhibited. Immunohistochemistry revealed that ephrinB2 was strongly expressed in osteoclasts in these areas. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that mRNA levels of NFATc1 , calcitonin receptor , and ephrinB2 were increased significantly in compressed RAW264.7 cells , and the expression of ephrinB2 , EphB4 , Sp7 , and Runx2 was decreased significantly in compressed ST2 cells. Conclusions : Our results indicate that compressive force can regulate EphB4 and ephrinB2 expression in osteoblasts and osteoclasts , which might contribute to alveolar bone resorption in compression areas during orthodontic tooth movement . Objective : To evaluate the effects of contamination by either blood or a hemostatic agent on the shear bond strength ( SBS ) of orthodontic buttons. Methods : We used 45 freshly extracted , non-carious , impacted third molars that were divided into 3 groups of 15. Each tooth was etched with 37 % phosphoric acid gel for 30 s. Human blood or the blood stopper agent was applied to the tooth surface in groups I and II , respectively. Group III teeth were untreated ( controls ) . Orthodontic buttons were bonded to the teeth using light-curing composite resin. After bonding , the SBS of the button was determined using a Universal testing machine. Any adhesive remaining after debonding was assessed and scored according to the modified adhesive remnant index ( ARI ) . ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey 's test was used to determine significant differences in SBS and Fisher 's exact test , to determine significant differences in ARI scores among groups. Results : ANOVA indicated a significant difference between groups ( p < 0.001 ) . The highest SBS values were measured in group III ( 10.73 ± 0.96 MPa ) . The SBS values for teeth in groups I and II were significantly lower than that of group III ( p < 0.001 ) . The lowest SBS values were observed in group I teeth ( 4.17 ± 1.11 MPa ) ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : Contamination of tooth surfaces with either blood or hemostatic agent significantly decreased the SBS of orthodontic buttons. When the contamination risk is high , it is recommended to use the blood stopper agent when bonding orthodontic buttons on impacted teeth . Objective : Facial-type-associated variations in diagnostic features have several implications in orthodontics. For example , in hyperdivergent craniofacial types , growth imbalances are compensated by displacement of the condyle. When diagnosis and treatment planning involves centric relation ( CR ) , detailed knowledge of the condylar position is desirable. The present study aimed to measure condylar displacement ( CD ) between CR and maximum intercuspation in three facial types of an asymptomatic orthodontic population. Methods : The study was conducted in 108 patients classified into three groups of 36 individuals each ( 27 women and 9 men ; mean age , 20.5 years ) , based on the following facial patterns : hyperdivergent , hypodivergent , and intermediate. To quantify CD along the horizontal and vertical axes , the condylar position was analyzed using mounted casts on a semi-adjustable articulator and a mandibular position indicator. The Student t-test was used to compare CD between the groups. Results : Vertical displacement was found to be significantly different between the hyperdivergent and hypodivergent groups ( p < 0.0002 ) and between the hyperdivergent and intermediate groups ( p < 0.0006 ) . The differences in horizontal displacement were not significant between the groups. In each group , vertical CD was more evident than horizontal displacement was. Conclusions : All facial types , especially the hyperdivergent type , carried a significantly high risk of CD. Therefore , the possibility of CD should be carefully evaluated and considered in the assessment of all orthodontic cases in order to accurately assess jaw relationships and avoid possible misdiagnosis . The purpose of this article is to introduce a simple appliance that uses a setup model and a nickel-titanium ( Ni-Ti ) wire for correcting the mesial rotation and drift of the permanent maxillary first molar. The technique involves bonding a Ni-Ti wire to the proper position of the target tooth on a setup model , followed by the fabrication of the transfer cap for indirect bonding and its transfer to the patient 's teeth. This appliance causes less discomfort and provides better oral hygiene for the patients than do conventional appliances such as the bracket , pendulum , and distal jet. The treatment time is also shorter with the new appliance than with full-fixed appliances. Moreover , the applicability of the new appliance can be expanded to many cases by using screws or splinting with adjacent teeth to improve anchorage . Objective : This study aimed to compare the effects of conventional and orthodontic mini-implant ( OMI ) anchorage on tooth movement and arch-dimension changes in the maxillary dentition in Class II division 1 ( CII div.1 ) patients. Methods : CII div.1 patients treated with extraction of the maxillary first and mandibular second premolars and sliding mechanics were allotted to conventional anchorage group ( CA , n = 12 ) or OMI anchorage group ( OA , n = 12 ) . Pre- and post-treatment three-dimensional virtual maxillary models were superimposed using the best-fit method. Linear , angular , and arch-dimension variables were measured with software program. Mann-Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were performed for statistical analysis. Results : Compared to the CA group , the OMI group showed more backward movement of the maxillary central and lateral incisors and canine ( MXCI , MXLI , MXC , respectively ; 1.6 mm , p < 0.001 ; 0.9 mm , p < 0.05 ; 1.2 mm , p < 0.001 ) ; more intrusion of the MXCI and MXC ( 1.3 mm , 0.5 mm , all p < 0.01 ) ; less forward movement of the maxillary second premolar , first , and second molars ( MXP2 , MXM1 , MXM2 , respectively ; all 1.0 mm , all p < 0.05 ) ; less contraction of the MXP2 and MXM1 ( 0.7 mm , p < 0.05 ; 0.9 mm , p < 0.001 ) ; less mesial-in rotation of the MXM1 and MXM2 ( 2.6° , 2.5° , all p < 0.05 ) ; and less decrease of the inter-MXP2 , MXM1 , and MXM2 widths ( 1.8 mm , 1.5 mm , 2.0 mm , all p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : In treatment of CII div.1 malocclusion , OA provided better anchorage and less arch-dimension change in the maxillary posterior teeth than CA during en-masse retraction of the maxillary anterior teeth . Objective : To investigate the dentoskeletal factors which may predict soft-tissue chin strain during lip closure. Methods : The pretreatment frontal and lateral facial photographs and lateral cephalograms of 209 women ( aged 18-30 years ) with Angle 's Class I or II malocclusion were examined. The subjects were categorized by three examiners into the no-strain and strain groups according to the soft-tissue chin tension or deformation during lip closure. Relationships of the cephalometric measurements with the group classification were analyzed by logistic regression analysis , and a classification and regression tree ( CART ) model was used to define the predictive variables for the group classification. Results : The lower the value of the overbite depth indicator ( ODI ) and the higher the values of upper incisor to Nasion-Pogonion ( U1-NPog , mm ) , overjet , and upper incisor to upper lip ( U1-upper lip , mm ) , the more likely was the subject to be classified into the strain group. The CART showed that U1-NPog was the most prominent predictor of soft-tissue chin strain ( cut-off value of 14.2 mm ) , followed by overjet. Conclusions : To minimize strain of the soft-tissue chin , orthodontic treatment should be oriented toward increasing the ODI value while decreasing the U1-NPog , overjet , and U1 upper lip values . Objective : This prospective clinical study aims to determine the differences between two treatment modalities for anterior open bite in growing patients. The treatment modalities involved the use of magnetic bite-blocks ( MBBs ) or rapid molar intruders ( RMIs ) applied with posterior bite-blocks. Methods : Fifteen consecutive patients with a mean age of 11.2 ( standard deviation [ SD ] = 1.6 ) years and a mean open bite of -3.9 mm were treated with MBBs. Another 15 consecutive patients with a mean age of 10.9 ( SD = 1.8 ) years and a mean open bite of -3.8 mm were treated with RMIs applied on bite-blocks. Cephalometric radiographs were obtained before ( T1 ) and immediately after appliance removal ( T2 ) . The treatments lasted four months , during which the appliances were cemented to the teeth. The morphological changes were measured in each group and compared using logistic regression analysis. Results : The MBB group exhibited significantly greater decreases in SNA angle , ANB angle , overjet , and maxillary incisor angle ( p < 0.05 ) . The MBBs induced greater effects on the maxilla and maxillary dentition. The MBBs restrained maxillary forward growth and retracted the maxillary incisors more effectively than did the RMIs. Consequently , changes in the intermaxillary relationships and overjets were more distinct in the MBB group. Conclusions : The anteroposterior differences between the appliances suggest that MBBs should be preferred for the treatment of patients with Class II open bites and maxillary incisor protrusions . The aim of this paper was to propose a new method of bimaxillary orthognathic surgery planning and model surgery based on the concept of 6 degrees of freedom ( DOF ) . A 22-year-old man with Class III malocclusion was referred to our clinic with complaints of facial deformity and chewing difficulty. To correct a prognathic mandible , facial asymmetry , flat occlusal plane angle , labioversion of the maxillary central incisors , and concavity of the facial profile , bimaxillary orthognathic surgery was planned. After preoperative orthodontic treatment , surgical planning based on the concept of 6 DOF was performed on a surgical treatment objective drawing , and a Jeon 's model surgery chart ( JMSC ) was prepared. Model surgery was performed with Jeon 's orthognathic surgery simulator ( JOSS ) using the JMSC , and an interim wafer was fabricated. Le Fort I osteotomy , bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy , and malar augmentation were performed. The patient received lateral cephalometric and posteroanterior cephalometric analysis in postretention for 1 year. The follow-up results were determined to be satisfactory , and skeletal relapse did not occur after 1.5 years of surgery. When maxillary and mandibular models are considered as rigid bodies , and their state of motion is described in a quantitative manner based on 6 DOF , sharing of exact information on locational movement in 3-dimensional space is possible. The use of JMSC and JOSS will actualize accurate communication and performance of model surgery among clinicians based on objective measurements . This case report presents the orthodontic treatment of a 25-year-old patient with skeletal Class II and severe maxillary arch crowding , moderate mandibular arch crowding , anterior crossbite , and a missing lower incisor. He was treated with molar distalization using a modified C-palatal plate and temporary anchorage devices to create sufficient space for retraction. The total treatment duration was 21 months. After treatment , his occlusion and smile esthetics showed significant improvement. The modified C-palatal plate represents a treatment modality that enhances the prospects of non-extraction treatment and reduces the need for extraction . Objective : To evaluate the presurgical orthodontic tooth movement of mandibular teeth after dental decompensation for skeletal Class III deformities on the basis of vertical skeletal patterns. Methods : This cohort was comprised of 62 patients who received presurgical orthodontic treatment. These patients were divided into 3 groups according to their vertical skeletal patterns. Changes in the positions of the mandibular central incisor , canine , premolar , and 1st molar after presurgical orthodontic treatment were measured using a cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) superimposition method. Results : The incisors moved forward after dental decompensation in all 3 groups. The canines in group I and the 1st premolars in groups I and III also moved forward. The incisors and canines were extruded in groups I and II. The 1st and 2nd premolars were also extruded in all groups. Vertical changes in the 1st premolars differed significantly between the groups. We also observed lateral movement of the canines in group III and of the 1st premolar , 2nd premolar , and 1st molar in all 3 groups ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Movement of the mandibular incisors and premolars resolved the dental compensation. The skeletal facial pattern did not affect the dental decompensation , except in the case of vertical changes of the 1st premolars . Objective : The purpose of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the cortical bone densities of the maxillary and mandibular alveolar processes in adults with different vertical facial types using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images. Methods : CBCT images ( n = 142 ) of adult patients ( 20-45 years ) were classified into hypodivergent , normodivergent , and hyperdivergent groups on the basis of linear and angular S-N/Go-Me measurements. The cortical bone densities ( in Hounsfield units ) at maxillary and mandibular interdental sites from the distal aspect of the canine to the mesial aspect of the second molar were measured on the images. Results : On the maxillary buccal side , female subjects in the hyperdivergent group showed significantly decreased bone density , while in the posterior region , male subjects in the hyperdivergent group displayed significantly decreased bone density when compared with corresponding subjects in the other groups ( p < 0.001 ) . Furthermore , the subjects in the hyperdivergent group had significantly lower bone densities on the mandibular buccal side than hypodivergent subjects. The maxillary palatal bone density did not differ significantly among groups , but female subjects showed significantly denser palatal cortical bone. No significant difference in bone density was found between the palatal and buccal sides in the maxillary premolar region. Overall , the palatal cortical bone was denser anteriorly and buccal cortical bone was denser posteriorly. Conclusion : Adults with the hyperdivergent facial type tend to have less-dense buccal cortical bone in the maxillary and mandibular alveolar processes. Clinicians should be aware of the variability of cortical bone densities at mini-implant placement sites . The purpose of this study was to investigate immediate changes in the mandibular dentition after maxillary molar distalization using headgear in non-growing patients. Sixteen patients ( mean age , 18.9 ± 2.0 years ) with Class II molar relationship and crowding were included in the present study. To correct the molar relationship , headgear was used for maxillary molar distalization. Cone-beam computed tomography-generated half-cephalograms ( CG Cephs ) and dental casts were used to evaluate dental changes for each subject before and immediately after molar distalization using headgear. The mean duration that subjects wore the headgear was 6.3 months. CG Cephs showed that the first maxillary molars were distalized 4.2 ± 1.6 mm with 9.7° ± 6.1° of distal angulation. The intercanine , interpremolar , and intermolar widths of the mandible increased after maxillary molar distalization. The present study 's results suggest that maxillary molar distalization using headgear induces a spontaneous response in the untreated mandibular dentition of non-growing patients . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of three different surface conditioning methods on the shear bond strength ( SBS ) of metal brackets bonded directly to gold alloy with chemically cured resin. Methods : Two hundred ten type III gold alloy specimens were randomly divided into six groups according to the combination of three different surface conditioning methods ( aluminum oxide sandblasting only , application of a metal primer after aluminum oxide sandblasting , silica coating and silanation ) and thermocycling ( with thermocycling , without thermocycling ) . After performing surface conditioning of specimens in accordance with each experimental condition , metal brackets were bonded to all specimens using a chemically cured resin. The SBS was measured at the moment of bracket debonding , and the resin remnants on the specimen surface were evaluated using the adhesive remnant index. Results : Application of metal primer after aluminum oxide sandblasting yielded a higher bond strength than that with aluminum oxide sandblasting alone ( p < 0.001 ) , and silica coating and silanation yielded a higher bond strength than that with metal primer after aluminum oxide sandblasting ( p < 0.001 ) . There was no significant change in SBS after thermocycling in all groups. Conclusions : With silica coating and silanation , clinically satisfactory bond strength can be attained when metal brackets are directly bonded to gold alloys using a chemically cured resin . Objective : This study investigated whether it is possible to use a two-dimensional ( 2D ) standard in three-dimensional ( 3D ) analysis , by comparing the angles and lengths measured from a midsagittal projection in 3D cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) with those measured by 2D lateral cephalometric radiography ( LCR ) . Methods : Fifty patients who underwent both LCR and CBCT were selected as subjects. CBCT was reoriented in 3 different methods and the measuring-points were projected onto the midsagittal plane. Twelve angle values and 8 length values were measured on both LCR and CBCT and compared. Results : Repeated measures analysis of the variance revealed statistically significant differences in 7 angular and 5 linear measurements among LCR and 3 types of CBCT ( p < 0.05 ) . Of these 12 measurements , multiple comparisons showed that 6 measurements ( ANB , AB to FH , IMPA , FMA , Co-Gn , Go-Me ) were not significantly different in pairwise comparisons. LCR was significantly different from 3 types of CBCT in 3 angular ( SN to FH , interincisal angle , FMIA ) and 2 linear ( S-Go , Co-ANS ) measurements. The CBCT method was similar for all measurements , except for 1 linear measurement , i.e. , S-N. However , the disparity between the mean values for all parameters was within the range of clinical measurement error. Conclusions:3D-CBCT analysis , using midsagittal projection , is a useful method in which the 2D-LCR normative values can be used. Although the measurements changed with reorientation , these changes were not clinically significant . Objective : To assess the position and movements of the hyoid bone during deglutition in patients with open bite. Methods : Thirty-six subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of anterior open bite. The open bite group ( OBG ) and control group each comprised 18 patients with a mean overbite of -4.9 ± 1.9 mm and 1.9 ± 0.7 mm. The position of the hyoid bone during the 4 stages of deglutition was evaluated by measuring vertical and horizontal movement of the bone. Results : Interactions of group and stage showed no significant effect on the measurements ( p > 0.05 ) . However , when group and stage were evaluated individually , they showed significant effects on the measurements ( p < 0.001 ) . In OBG , the hyoid bone was more inferiorly and posteriorly positioned , and this position continued during the deglutition stages. Conclusions : The hyoid bone reaches the maximum anterior position at the oral stage and maximum superior position at the pharyngeal stage during deglutition. Open bite does not change the displacement pattern of the bone during deglutition. The hyoid bone is positioned more inferiorly and posteriorly in patients with open bite because of released tension on the suprahyoid muscles . Objective : To evaluate the factors that affect torque control during anterior retraction when utilizing the C-retractor with a palatal miniplate as an exclusive source of anchorage without posterior appliances. Methods : The C-retractor was modeled using a 3-dimensional beam element ( 0.9-mm-diameter stainless-steel wire ) attached to mesh bonding pads. Various vertical heights and 2 attachment positions for the lingual anterior retraction hooks ( LARHs ) were evaluated. A force of 200 g was applied from each side hook of the miniplate to the splinted segment of 6 or 8 anterior teeth. Results : During anterior retraction , an increase in the LARH vertical height increased the amount of lingual root torque and intrusion of the incisors. In particular , with increasing vertical height , the tooth displacement pattern changed from controlled tipping to bodily displacement and then to lingual root displacement. The effects were enhanced when the LARH was located between the central and lateral incisors , as compared to when the LARH was located between the lateral incisors and canines. Conclusions : Three-dimensional lingual anterior retraction of the 6 or 8 anterior teeth can be accomplished using the palatal miniplate as the only anchorage source. Using LARHs at different heights or positions affects the quality of torque and intrusion . Objective : To evaluate the active-treatment effects of the Forsus fatigue resistant device ( Forsus ) during comprehensive correction of Class II malocclusion in growing patients. Methods : Fifty-four patients ( mean age , 12.5 ± 1.2 years ) with Class II division 1 malocclusion were consecutively treated with fixed app-liances in combination with Forsus. Lateral cephalograms were analyzed at the beginning of the fixed treatment ( T1 ) , Forsus insertion ( T2 ) , its removal ( T3 ) , and end of the comprehensive therapy ( T4 ) . Statistical comparisons were carried out by repeated-measures ANOVA with Tukey 's post-hoc test ( p < 0.05 ) . Results : The overall therapeutic effects were mainly dentoalveolar and occurred mostly during the active treatment with Forsus ( T2-T3 , mean duration = 0.5 ± 0.1 years ) . The overjet and overbite decreased significantly ( -3.5 and -1.5 mm , respectively ) and the molar relationship improved by 4.3 mm. These changes were associated with significant retroclination of the maxillary incisors ( -3.1° ) , proclination and intrusion of the mandibular incisors ( +5.0° and -1.5 mm , respectively ) , and mesialization of the mandibular molars ( +2.0 mm ) . Conclusions : Forsus had mainly dentoalveolar effects and contributed largely to the overall therapeutic outcome . Objective : Esthetic improvements during orthodontic treatment are achieved by changes in positions of the lips and surrounding soft tissues. Facial soft-tissue movement has already been two-dimensionally evaluated by cephalometry. In this study , we aimed to three-dimensionally assess positional changes of the adult upper lip according to simulated maxillary anterior tooth movements by white light scanning. Methods : We measured changes in three-dimensional coordinates of labial landmarks in relation to maxillary incisor movements of normal adults simulated with films of varying thickness by using a white light scanner. Results : With increasing protraction , the upper lip moved forward and significantly upward. Labial movement was limited by the surrounding soft tissues. The extent of movement above the vermilion border was slightly less than half that of the teeth , showing strong correlation. Most changes were concentrated in the depression above the upper vermilion border. Labial movement toward the nose was reduced significantly. Conclusions : After adequately controlling several variables and using white light scanning with high reproducibility and accuracy , the coefficient of determination showed moderate values ( 0.40-0.77 ) and significant changes could be determined. This method would be useful to predict soft-tissue positional changes according to tooth movements . Objective : To evaluate the bioactivity , and the biomechanical and bone-regenerative properties of Ti6Al4V miniscrews subjected to anodization , cyclic precalcification , and heat treatment ( APH treatment ) and their potential clinical use. Methods : The surfaces of Ti6Al4V alloys were modified by APH treatment. Bioactivity was assessed after immersion in simulated body fluid for 3 days. The hydrophilicity and the roughness of APH-treated surfaces were compared with those of untreated ( UT ) and anodized and heat-treated ( AH ) samples. For in vivo tests , 32 miniscrews ( 16 UT and 16 APH ) were inserted into 16 Wistar rats , one UT and one APH-treated miniscrew in either tibia. The miniscrews were extracted after 3 and 6 weeks and their osseointegration ( n = 8 for each time point and group ) was investigated by surface and histological analyses and removal torque measurements. Results : APH treatment formed a dense surface array of nanotubular TiO2 layer covered with a compact apatite-like film. APH-treated samples showed better bioactivity and biocompatibility compared with UT and AH samples. In vivo , APH-treated miniscrews showed higher removal torque and bone-to-implant contact than did UT miniscrews , after both 3 and 6 weeks ( p < 0.05 ) . Also , early deposition of densely mineralized bone around APH-treated miniscrews was observed , implying good bonding to the treated surface. Conclusions : APH treatment enhanced the bioactivity , and the biomechanical and bone regenerative properties of the Ti6Al4V alloy miniscrews. The enhanced initial stability afforded should be valuable in orthodontic applications . The aim of this case report is to describe the treatment of a patient with skeletal Class III malocclusion with maxillary retrognathia using skeletal anchorage devices and intermaxillary elastics. Miniplates were inserted between the mandibular lateral incisor and canine teeth on both sides in a male patient aged 14 years 5 months. Self-drilling mini-implants ( 1.6 mm diameter , 10 mm length ) were installed between the maxillary second premolar and molar teeth , and Class III elastics were used between the miniplates and miniscrews. On treatment completion , an increase in the projection of the maxilla relative to the cranial base ( 2.7 mm ) and significant improvement of the facial profile were observed. Slight maxillary counterclockwise ( 1° ) and mandibular clockwise ( 3.3° ) rotations were also observed. Maxillary protraction with skeletal anchorage and intermaxillary elastics was effective in correcting a case of Skeletal Class III malocclusion without dentoalveolar side effects . Objective : To evaluate the shapes and sizes of nasopharyngeal airways by using cone-beam computed tomography and to assess the relationship between nasopharyngeal airway shape and adenoid hypertrophy in children. Methods : Linear and cross-sectional measurements on frontal and sagittal cross-sections containing the most enlarged adenoids and nasopharyngeal airway volumes were obtained from cone-beam computed tomography scans of 64 healthy children ( 11.0 ± 1.8 years ) , and the interrelationships of these measurements were evaluated. Results : On the basis of frontal section images , the subjects ' nasopharyngeal airways were divided into the following 2 types : the broad and long type and the narrow and flat type. The nasopharyngeal airway sizes and volumes were smaller in subjects with narrow and flat airways than in those with broad and long airways ( p < 0.01 ) . Children who showed high adenoid-nasopharyngeal ratios on sagittal imaging , indicating moderate to severe adenoid hypertrophy , had the narrow and flat type nasopharyngeal airway ( p < 0.01 ) . Conclusions : Cone-beam computed tomography is a clinically simple , reliable , and noninvasive tool that can simultaneously visualize the entire structure and a cross section of the nasopharyngeal airway and help in measurement of adenoid size as well as airway volume in children with adenoid hypertrophy . Objective : We aimed to investigate the effects of silanation time on the shear bond strength ( SBS ) of metal brackets on gold alloy in a silicoating procedure and compare the SBS of metal brackets on gold alloy and enamel. Methods : Type III gold alloy plates were sandblasted with 30-µm silicon dioxide. Excess particles were removed with gentle air after silica coating , and silane was applied. Maxillary central-incisor metal brackets were bonded to each conditioned alloy surface with a light curing resin adhesive for 1 s , 30 s , 60 s , or 120 s after applying silane. The brackets were also bonded to 36 upper central incisors with the same adhesive. All samples were cured for 40 s with a light emitting diode curing light. The SBS was tested after 1 h and after 24 h. The adhesive remnant index ( ARI ) of the samples was also compared. Results : The 60-s and 120-s silanation time groups showed a higher SBS than the other groups ( p < 0.05 ) . Samples tested after 24 h showed a significantly higher SBS than did the samples tested after 1 h ( p < 0.05 ) . The 1-s group showed higher ARI scores. The one-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls test showed that the SBS values of the 60-s and 120-s silanation time groups were not significantly different from the SBS values of enamel. Conclusions : Adequate silanation time is required to produce sufficient bond strength during silicoating . Objective : This study evaluated the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of fixed orthodontic treatment with three different light-cured orthodontic bonding composites by analyzing micronucleus ( MN ) formation in the buccal mucosa during a 6-month period. Methods : Thirty healthy volunteers were selected from consecutive patients referred for orthodontic treatment. Equilibrium 2 brackets and molar tubes ( Dentaurum ) were bonded with three different light-cured orthodontic bonding composites-Transbond XT ( 3M Unitek ) , Kurasper F ( Kuraray Europe ) , or GrenGloo ( Ormco Corporation ) - to all teeth in both arches. Exfoliated buccal epithelial cells were scraped from the middle part of the inner cheeks with sterile cement spatulas before treatment and at 1 , 3 , and 6 months after treatment. MNs and nuclear alterations , such as karyorrhexis ( KR ) , karyolysis ( KL ) , and binucleated cells ( BNs ) , were scored under a light microscope. Repeated measure ANOVA was used to calculate statistical differences in degenerative nuclear abnormalities. Results : MN rates did not significantly differ among different time points within the same cell type ( p > 0.05 ) . In contrast , the number of BNs in buccal epithelial cells significantly increased in all composite groups ( p < 0.01 , Transbond XT ; p < 0.001 , Kurasper F and GrenGloo ) . KL frequency significantly increased between the beginning and end of the study in the Kurasfer F ( 0.80 ± 0.79 to 1.90 ± 1.10 ; p < 0.05 ) and GrenGloo ( 1.30 ± 1.06 to 2.40 ± 1.08 ; p < 0.05 ) groups. Conclusions : After 6 months of fixed orthodontic treatment with different light-cured composites , morphological signs of cytotoxicity were observed but genotoxic effects were absent . Piezoelectric surgery is a novel surgical approach used in orthodontic treatment for rapid tooth movement. This paper presents a case series wherein osseous outgrowths were observed in response to piezosurgery-assisteden-masseretraction. Sixteen patients requiring upper premolar extractions were treated with miniscrew-supporteden-masseretraction and received minimally invasive decortication via piezosurgery. Computed tomography ( CT ) of the maxillary anterior region was performed to investigate the nature of the outgrowths. In 8 of the 16 patients , hemispheric or disc-shaped osseous outgrowths were observed on the sites where piezosurgery was performed during retraction. CT images revealed that these outgrowths were alveolar bone. This case series presents a previously unreported osseous response to piezosurgery-assisted tooth movement during orthodontic treatment. The response is mostly transient and is observed in 50 % of the treated patients , suggesting a bone turnover that can be assessed clinically and radiographically . Objective : The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term changes in the pharyngeal airway dimensions after functional appliance treatment in adolescents with skeletal Class II malocclusions. Methods : Pharyngeal airway dimensions were compared between subjects with skeletal Class II malocclusions ( n = 24 ; mean age : 11.6 ± 1.29 years ) treated with a Class II bionator and age-matched control subjects with skeletal Class I occlusions ( n = 24 ; mean age : 11.0 ± 1.21 years ) using a series of lateral cephalograms obtained at the initial visit ( T0 ) , after treatment ( T1 ) , and at the completion of growth ( T2 ) . Results : The length of the nasopharyngeal region was similar between adolescents with skeletal Class I and Class II malocclusions at all time points , while the lengths of the upper and lower oropharyngeal regions and the pharyngeal airway areas were significantly smaller in the skeletal Class II adolescents before treatment when compared to the control adolescents ( p < 0.05 ) . However , following treatment with a functional appliance , the skeletal Class II adolescents had increased pharyngeal airway dimensions , which became similar to those of the control subjects. Conclusions : Functional appliance therapy can increase the pharyngeal airway dimensions in growing adolescents with skeletal Class II malocclusions , and this effect is maintained until the completion of growth . Objective : This study was performed to investigate buccal facial depth ( BFD ) changes after extraction and nonextraction orthodontic treatments in post-adolescent and adult female patients , and to explore possible influencing factors. Methods : Twelve and nine female patients were enrolled in the extraction and nonextraction groups , respectively. Changes in BFD in the defined buccal region and six transverse and two coronal measuring planes were measured after registering pretreatment and posttreatment three-dimensional facial scans. Changes in posterior dentoalveolar arch widths were also measured. Treatment duration , changes in body mass index ( BMI ) , and cephalometric variables were compared between the groups. Results : BFD in the buccal region decreased by approximately 1.45 mm in the extraction group , but no significant change was observed in the nonextraction group. In the extraction group , the decrease in BFD was identical between the two coronal measuring planes , whereas this differed among the six transverse measuring planes. Posterior dentoalveolar arch widths decreased in the extraction group , whereas these increased at the second premolar level in the nonextraction group. The treatment duration of the extraction group was twice that of the nonextraction group. No differences were found in BMI and Frankfort horizontal-mandibular plane angle changes between the groups. BFD changes in the buccal region moderately correlated with treatment duration and dental arch width change. Conclusions : BFD decreased in adult female patients undergoing extraction , and this may be influenced by the long treatment duration and constriction of dentoalveolar arch width. However , nonextraction treatment did not significantly alter BFD . Objectives : To determine the prevalence of incidental maxillary sinus findings in a large sample of orthodontic patients by cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) with a wide field of view and assess the relationships of such abnormalities with age and gender. Methods : Five hundred thirteen CBCT scans obtained for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning in a Northern Italian population ( N = 513 ; 292 female and 221 male subjects ; 1,026 maxillary sinuses ) were studied. The frequencies of pseudocysts and mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinus were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the influence of age and gender on these abnormalities. Results : Pseudocysts were detected in 52 patients ( 10.1 % ) and 59 sinuses ( 5.75 % ) . Mucosal thickening was observed in 206 patients ( 40.1 % ) and 258 sinuses ( 25.1 % ) . Gender and age were significantly associated with pseudocysts ( p = 0.027 ) and mucosal thickening ( p < 0.001 ) , respectively. Conclusions : Half of the orthodontic patients had incidental maxillary sinus findings. Men were more likely to show pseudocysts , and older patients ( aged 41 - 60 years ) were more likely to show mucosal thickening . Objective : To evaluate the therapeutic effects of a preformed assembly of nickel-titanium ( NiTi ) and stainless steel ( SS ) archwires ( preformed C-wire ) combined with temporary skeletal anchorage devices ( TSADs ) as the sole source of anchorage and to compare these effects with those of a SS version of C-wire ( conventional C-wire ) for en-masse retraction. Methods : Thirty-one adult female patients with skeletal Class I or II dentoalveolar protrusion , mild-to-moderate anterior crowding ( 3.0-6.0 mm ) , and stable Class I posterior occlusion were divided into conventional ( n = 15 ) and preformed ( n = 16 ) C-wire groups. All subjects underwent first premolar extractions and en-masse retraction with pre-adjusted edgewise anterior brackets , the assigned C-wire , and maxillary C-tubes or C-implants ; bonded mesh-tube appliances were used in the mandibular dentition. Differences in pretreatment and post-retraction measurements of skeletal , dental , and soft-tissue cephalometric variables were statistically analyzed. Results : Both groups showed full retraction of the maxillary anterior teeth by controlled tipping and space closure without altered posterior occlusion. However , the preformed C-wire group had a shorter retraction period ( by 3.2 months ) . Furthermore , the maxillary molars in this group showed no significant mesialization , mesial tipping , or extrusion ; some mesialization and mesial tipping occurred in the conventional C-wire group. Conclusions : Preformed C-wires combined with maxillary TSADs enable simultaneous leveling and space closure from the beginning of the treatment without maxillary posterior bonding. This allows for faster treatment of dentoalveolar protrusion without unwanted side effects , when compared with conventional C-wire , evidencing its clinical expediency . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of the 3-dimensional ( 3D ) superimposition method of digital models in patients who received treatment with rapid maxillary expansion ( RME ) and maxillary protraction headgear. Methods : The material consisted of pre- and post-treatment maxillary dental casts and lateral cephalograms of 30 patients , who underwent RME and maxillary protraction headgear treatment. Digital models were superimposed using the palate as a reference area. The movement of the maxillary central incisor and the first molar was measured on superimposed cephalograms and 3D digital models. To determine whether any difference existed between the 2 measuring techniques , intra-class correlation ( ICC ) and Bland-Altman plots were analyzed. Results : The measurements on the 3D digital models and cephalograms showed a very high correlation in the antero-posterior direction ( ICC , 0.956 for central incisor and 0.941 for first molar ) and a moderate correlation in the vertical direction ( ICC , 0.748 for central incisor and 0.717 for first molar ) . Conclusions : The 3D model superimposition method using the palate as a reference area is as clinically reliable for assessing antero-posterior tooth movement as cephalometric superimposition , even in cases treated with orthopedic appliances , such as RME and maxillary protraction headgear . Objective : To determine and compare the frequency distribution of various arch shapes in ethnic Malays and Malaysian Aborigines in Peninsular Malaysia and to investigate the morphological differences of arch form between these two ethnic groups. Methods : We examined 120 ethnic Malay study models ( 60 maxillary , 60 mandibular ) and 129 Malaysian Aboriginal study models ( 66 maxillary , 63 mandibular ) . We marked 18 buccal tips and incisor line angles on each model , and digitized them using 2-dimensional coordinate system. Dental arches were classified as square , ovoid , or tapered by printing the scanned images and superimposing Orthoform arch templates on them. Results : The most common maxillary arch shape in both ethnic groups was ovoid , as was the most common mandibular arch shape among ethnic Malay females. The rarest arch shape was square. Chi-square tests , indicated that only the distribution of the mandibular arch shape was significantly different between groups ( p = 0.040 ) . However , when compared using independent t-tests , there was no difference in the mean value of arch width between groups. Arch shape distribution was not different between genders of either ethnic group , except for the mandibular arch of ethnic Malays. Conclusions : Ethnic Malays and Malaysian Aborigines have similar dental arch dimensions and shapes . Objective : This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and precision of polyurethane ( PUT ) dental arch models fabricated using a three-dimensional ( 3D ) subtractive rapid prototyping ( RP ) method with an intraoral scanning technique by comparing linear measurements obtained from PUT models and conventional plaster models. Methods : Ten plaster models were duplicated using a selected standard master model and conventional impression , and 10 PUT models were duplicated using the 3D subtractive RP technique with an oral scanner. Six linear measurements were evaluated in terms of x , y , and z-axes using a non-contact white light scanner. Accuracy was assessed using mean differences between two measurements , and precision was examined using four quantitative methods and the Bland-Altman graphical method. Repeatability was evaluated in terms of intra-examiner variability , and reproducibility was assessed in terms of inter-examiner and inter-method variability. Results : The mean difference between plaster models and PUT models ranged from 0.07 mm to 0.33 mm. Relative measurement errors ranged from 2.2 % to 7.6 % and intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.93 to 0.96 , when comparing plaster models and PUT models. The Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement. Conclusions : The accuracy and precision of PUT dental models for evaluating the performance of oral scanner and subtractive RP technology was acceptable. Because of the recent improvements in block material and computerized numeric control milling machines , the subtractive RP method may be a good choice for dental arch models . Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate the isolation and characterization of multipotent human periodontal ligament ( PDL ) stem cells and to assess their ability to differentiate into bone , cartilage , and adipose tissue. Methods : PDL stem cells were isolated from 7 extracted human premolar teeth. Human PDL cells were expanded in culture , stained using anti-CD29 , -CD34 , -CD44 , and -STRO-1 antibodies , and sorted by fluorescent activated cell sorting ( FACS ) . Gingival fibroblasts ( GFs ) served as a positive control. PDL stem cells and GFs were cultured using standard conditions conducive for osteogenic , chondrogenic , or adipogenic differentiation. Results : An average of 152.8 ± 27.6 colony-forming units was present at day 7 in cultures of PDL stem cells. At day 4 , PDL stem cells exhibited a significant increase in proliferation ( p < 0.05 ) , reaching nearly double the proliferation rate of GFs. About 5.6 ± 4.5 % of cells in human PDL tissues were strongly STRO-1-positive. In osteogenic cultures , calcium nodules were observed by day 21 in PDL stem cells , which showed more intense calcium staining than GF cultures. In adipogenic cultures , both cell populations showed positive Oil Red O staining by day 21. Additionally , in chondrogenic cultures , PDL stem cells expressed collagen type II by day 21. Conclusions : The PDL contains multipotent stem cells that have the potential to differentiate into osteoblasts , chondrocytes , and adipocytes. This adult PDL stem cell population can be utilized as potential sources of PDL in tissue engineering applications . Objective : In this study , we aimed to examine the relationship between chin deviation and the positional and morphological features of the mandible and to determine the factors that contributed to chin deviation in individuals with a unilateral cleft lip and palate ( UCLP ) . Methods : Cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images of 28 adults with UCLP were analyzed in this study. Segmented three-dimensional temporomandibular fossa and mandible images were reconstructed , and angular , linear , and volumetric parameters were measured. Results : For all 28 individuals , the chin was found to deviate to the cleft side by 1.59 mm. Moreover , among these 28 individuals , only 7 showed distinct ( more than 4 mm ) chin deviation , which was toward the cleft side. Compared to the non-cleft side , the mandibular body length , frontal ramal inclination , and vertical position of the condyle were lower and inclination of the temporomandibular fossa was steeper on the cleft side. Furthermore , the differences in inclination of the temporomandibular fossa , mandibular body length , ramus length , and condylar volume ratio ( non-deviated/deviated ) were positively correlated with chin deviation. Conclusions : UCLP individuals show mild chin deviation to the cleft side. Statistical differences were noted in the parameters that represented positional and morphological asymmetries of the mandible and temporomandibular fossa ; however , these differences were too small to indicate clinical significance . Objective : To evaluate the effects of ultrasonic instrumentation with different scaler-tip angulations on the shear bond strength ( SBS ) and bond failure mode of metallic orthodontic brackets. Methods : Adhesive pre-coated metallic brackets were bonded to 72 extracted human premolars embedded in autopolymerizing acrylic resin. The teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups ( n = 24 each ) to undergo no treatment ( control group ) or ultrasonic instrumentation with a scaler-tip angulation of 45° ( 45°-angulation group ) or 0° ( 0°-angulation group ) . SBS was tested in a universal testing machine , and adhesive remnant index ( ARI ) scores were recorded. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used for statistical analysis. Results : The control group had a significantly higher mean SBS value than the treated groups , which showed no significant differences in their mean SBS values. The ARI scores were not significantly different among the groups. Conclusions : Ultrasonic instrumentation around the bracket base reduces the SBS of metallic orthodontic brackets , emphasizing the need for caution during professional oral hygiene procedures in orthodontic patients. The scaler-tip angulation does not influence the SBS reduction and bond failure mode of such brackets . Objective : To identify the right and left difference of the facial soft tissue landmarks three-dimensionally from the subjects of normal occlusion individuals. Materials and methods : Cone-beam computed tomography ( CT ) scans were obtained in 48 normal occlusion adults ( 24 men , 24 women ) , and reconstructed into 3-dimensional ( 3D ) models by using a 3D image soft ware. 3D position of 27 soft tissue landmarks , 9 midline and 9 pairs of bilateral landmarks , were identified in 3D coordination system , and their right and left differences were calculated and analyzed. Results : The right and left difference values derived from the study ranged from 0.6 to 4.6 mm indicating a high variability according to the landmarks. In general , the values showed a tendency to increase according to the lower and lateral positioning of the landmarks in the face. Overall differences were determined not only by transverse differences but also by sagittal and vertical differences , indicating that 3D evaluation would be essential in the facial soft tissue analysis. Conclusions : Means and standard deviations of the right and left difference of facial soft tissue landmarks derived from this study can be used as the diagnostic standard values for the evaluation of facial asymmetry . Objective : To evaluate the antimicrobial effect of different frequencies of brushing with fluoride toothpaste on the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in children undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. Methods : The study included 22 patients scheduled for fixed orthodontic therapy distributed between 2 groups with different hygiene regimes. All the subjects received identical braces , bands , and brackets bonded with the same material. Stimulated saliva samples were obtained before placement of the appliance and at 6 , 12 , and 18 weeks during the therapy. Saliva samples were cultured on selective microbial agar for the detection of microorganisms. Results : Salivary mutans streptococci were significantly suppressed throughout the experimental period in the group that brushed 4 times a day as compared to the group that brushed twice a day. Salivary lactobacilli were not significantly affected by the frequency of brushing with 0.32 % sodium fluoride ( NaF ) toothpaste. Conclusions : The use of 0.32 % NaF-containing toothpaste more than 3 times a day has effective antimicrobial activity on mutans streptococci but not lactobacilli in the saliva of children with fixed orthodontic appliances . Objective : To evaluate the efficiency of the Frog appliance ( FA ) alone or in combination with headgear for distalizing the maxillary molars. Methods : Fifty patients ( 25 males and 25 females ) aged 12.6 - 16.7 years who received treatment for Class II malocclusion at the Orthodontic Clinic of Al-Baath University were selected for this study and randomly divided into 2 equal groups. Maxillary molar distalization was achieved using the FA alone ( group 1 ) or a combination of the FA with high-pull headgear worn at night ( group 2 ) . Lateral cephalograms were obtained before and after treatment. Results : The maxillary molars moved distally by 5.51 and 5.93 mm in groups 1 and 2 , respectively. Distal movements were associated with axial tipping by 4.96° and 1.25° , and with loss of anchorage by mesial movement of the second maxillary premolars by 2.70 and 0.90 mm in groups 1 and 2 , respectively. The combined use of the FA and nighttime high-pull headgear decreased the distalization time and improved the ratio of maxillary molar distalization movement relative to the overall opening space between the first maxillary molars and second premolars. Conclusions : The FA can effectively distalize the maxillary molars , this distalization associates with some unfavorable changes. Nighttime use of high-pull headgear combined with the FA can reduce these unfavorable changes and improve treatment outcomes . Maxillary protraction is the conventional treatment for growing Class III patients with maxillary deficiency , but it has undesirable dental effects. The purpose of this report is to introduce an alternative modality of maxillary protraction in patients with dentoskeletal Class III malocclusion using a modified C-palatal plate connected with elastics to a face mask. This method improved skeletal measurements , corrected overjet , and slightly improved the profile. The patients may require definitive treatment in adolescence or adulthood. The modified C-palatal plate enables nonsurgical maxillary advancement with maximal skeletal effects and minimal dental side effects . Objective : To evaluate the relative importance of bilabial prominence in relation to other facial profile parameters in a normal population. Methods : Profile stimulus images of 38 individuals ( 28 female and 10 male ; ages 19-25 years ) were shown to an unrelated group of first-year students ( n = 42 ; ages 18-24 years ) . The images were individually viewed on a 17-inch monitor. The observers received standardized instructions before viewing. A six-question questionnaire was completed using a Likert-type scale. The responses were analyzed by ordered logistic regression to identify associations between profile characteristics and observer preferences. The Bayesian Information Criterion was used to select variables that explained observer preferences most accurately. Results : Nasal , bilabial , and chin prominences ; the nasofrontal angle ; and lip curls had the greatest effect on overall profile attractiveness perceptions. The lip-chin-throat angle and upper lip curl had the greatest effect on forehead prominence perceptions. The bilabial prominence , nasolabial angle ( particularly the lower component ) , and mentolabial angle had the greatest effect on nasal prominence perceptions. The bilabial prominence , nasolabial angle , chin prominence , and submental length had the greatest effect on lip prominence perceptions. The bilabial prominence , nasolabial angle , mentolabial angle , and submental length had the greatest effect on chin prominence perceptions. Conclusions : More prominent lips , within normal limits , may be considered more attractive in the profile view. Profile parameters have a greater influence on their neighboring aesthetic units but indirectly influence related profile parameters , endorsing the importance of achieving an aesthetic balance between relative prominences of all aesthetic units of the facial profile . Objective : We compared the skeletal and dental changes that resulted from the use of two methods of intermaxillary fixation ( IMF ) -miniscrews and surgical archwire-in 74 adult patients who had Class III malocclusion and were treated with the same orthognathic surgical procedure at a hospital in Korea. Methods : All the patients underwent Le Fort I osteotomy and bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy with rigid fixation. They were divided into two groups according to the type of IMF used-group 1 underwent surgical archwire fixation and group 2 underwent orthodontic miniscrew fixation. In a series of cephalograms for each patient , we compared vertical and horizontal tooth-position measurements : ( a ) immediately after surgery ( T0 ) , ( b ) 3 months after surgery ( T1 ) , and ( c ) 6 months after surgery ( T2 ) . Cephalometric changes within each group were examined using one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) while the independent samples t-test procedure was used to compare the two groups. Results : After surgery , the maxillary incisors tended to be proclined in both groups although there were no significant differences. Incisor overbite increased significantly in both groups from T0 to T1 , and the miniscrew group ( group 2 ) showed slightly greater overbite than the archwire group ( group 1 ) . Conclusions : This study suggest that the use of orthodontic miniscrews and orthodontic surgical archwire for IMF in adult patients results in similar skeletal and dental changes . Objective : This in vitro study was undertaken to evaluate the physical , chemical , and biological properties of commercially available metal orthodontic brackets in South Korea , because national standards for these products are lacking. Methods : FOUR BRACKET BRANDS WERE TESTED FOR DIMENSIONAL ACCURACY , ( MANUFACTURING ERRORS IN ANGULATION AND TORQUE ) , CYTOTOXICITY , COMPOSITION , ELUTION , AND CORROSION : Archist ( Daeseung Medical ) , Victory ( 3M Unitek ) , Kosaka ( Tomy ) , and Confidence ( Shinye Odontology Materials ) . Results : The tested rackets showed no significant differences in manufacturing errors in angulation , but Confidence brackets showed a significant difference in manufacturing errors in torque. None of the brackets were cytotoxic to mouse fibroblasts. The metal ion components did not show a regular increasing or decreasing trend of elution over time , but the volume of the total eluted metal ions increased : Archist brackets had the maximal Cr elution and Confidence brackets appeared to have the largest volume of total eluted metal ions because of excessive Ni elution. Confidence brackets showed the lowest corrosion resistance during potentiodynamic polarization. Conclusions : The results of this study could potentially be applied in establishing national standards for metal orthodontic brackets and in evaluating commercially available products . Objective : To evaluate the differences in maxillomandibular transverse measurements at either the crown or the estimated center of resistance ( CR ) , and to compare values between normal occlusion and Class III malocclusion groups. Methods : Dental casts and computed tomography ( CT ) data from 30 individuals with normal occlusion and 30 with skeletal Class III malocclusions were evaluated. Using the casts , dental arch widths ( DAWs ) were measured from the cusp tips , and basal arch widths ( BAWs-cast ) were measured as the distance between the points at the mucogingival junction adjacent to the respective cusp tips. The BAWs determined from CT ( BAWs-CT ) images were measured from the estimated CRs of the teeth. Results : None of the DAW measurements or maxillomandibular DAW differences showed statistically significant intergroup differences. In contrast , the maxillary BAWs-CT and BAWs-cast were lesser in the Class III malocclusion group than in the normal occlusion group. The mandibular BAWs-CT were significantly greater in the Class III malocclusion group than in the normal occlusion group. Moreover , the maxillomandibular BAW differences on both CT and cast showed significant intergroup differences in all transverse measurements. Conclusions : The maxillomandibular DAW differences showed no significant intergroup differences. In contrast , the maxillomandibular BAW differences on both CT and cast showed significant intergroup differences in all transverse measurements. The maxillomandibular BAW differences at the estimated CRs , measured using CT or casts , can reveal underlying transverse maxillary basal arch deficiencies in patients with skeletal Class III malocclusions . Objective : The purpose of this study was to analyze stress distributions in the roots , periodontal ligaments ( PDLs ) , and bones around cylindrical and tapered miniscrews inserted at different angles using a finite element analysis. Methods : We created a three-dimensional ( 3D ) maxilla model of a dentition with extracted first premolars and used 2 types of miniscrews ( tapered and cylindrical ) with 1.45-mm diameters and 8-mm lengths. The miniscrews were inserted at 30° , 60° , and 90° angles with respect to the bone surface. A simulated horizontal orthodontic force of 2 N was applied to the miniscrew heads. Then , the stress distributions , magnitudes during miniscrew placement , and force applications were analyzed with a 3D finite element analysis. Results : Stresses were primarily absorbed by cortical bone. Moreover , very little stress was transmitted to the roots , PDLs , and cancellous bone. During cylindrical miniscrew insertion , the maximum von Mises stress increased as insertion angle decreased. Tapered miniscrews exhibited greater maximum von Mises stress than cylindrical miniscrews. During force application , maximum von Mises stresses increased in both groups as insertion angles decreased. Conclusions : For both cylindrical and tapered miniscrew designs , placement as perpendicular to the bone surface as possible is recommended to reduce stress in the surrounding bone . Objective : To evaluate condylar head remodeling after mandibular set-back sagittal split ramus osteotomy ( SSRO ) with rigid fixation in skeletal class III deformities. The correlation between condylar head remodeling and condylar axis changes was determined using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) superimposition. Methods : The CBCT data of 22 subjects ( 9 men and 13 women ) who had undergone mandibular set-back SSRO with rigid fixation were analyzed. Changes in the condylar head measurements and the distribution of the signs of condylar head remodeling were evaluated by CBCT superimposition. Results : The subjects showed inward rotation of the axial condylar angle ; reduced condylar heights on the sagittal and coronal planes ; and resorptive remodeling in the anterior and superior areas on the sagittal plane , superior and lateral areas on the coronal plane , and anterior-middle and anterior-lateral areas on the axial plane ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : The CBCT superimposition method showed condylar head remodeling after mandibular set-back SSRO with rigid fixation. In skeletal class III patients , SSRO with rigid fixation resulted in rotation , diminution , and remodeling of the condylar head. However , these changes did not produce clinical signs or symptoms of temporomandibular disorders . Objective : This study aimed to evaluate the mean age of menarche , its secular trend in Korean women , and the relationship between malocclusion and the rate of skeletal maturation , as defined by menarcheal age. Methods : We retrospectively collected data on menarcheal age from 931 Korean women born during 1961 - 1997. Subjects were divided by the malocclusion type and birth-year decade into 3 and 4 groups , respectively. The mean menarcheal age for each group was determined , and one-way ANOVA was performed for intergroup comparison ( p = 0.05 ) . Two-way ANOVA was also performed to compare all the 12 subgroups ( p = 0.05 ) . Results : The mean age of menarche was 12.82 years for Korean women born during 1961 - 1997. A distinct downward secular trend of menarcheal age was noticed ( p < 0.05 ) . For the birth-year decade 1961 - 1970 , the Class III malocclusion group showed earlier onset of menarche than the other malocclusion groups ( p < 0.05 ) , but the other birth-year groups did not show any significant difference in the type of malocclusion ( p > 0.05 ) . Conclusions : A positive secular trend towards earlier menarche exists among Korean women. Malocclusion does not show any significant relationship with the rate of skeletal maturation , as defined by menarcheal age . This case report illustrates the successful treatment of a patient with skeletal Class II malocclusion and an unesthetic smile involving excessive gingival display and large buccal corridors. By applying dual buccal interradicular miniscrews , total intrusion of the maxillary dentition along with distalization was induced to improve both the occlusion and smile esthetics. In addition to the conventional cephalometric superimposition , three-dimensional superimposition was performed and evaluated to validate the treatment outcome . [ This corrects the article on p. 21 in vol. 47 , PMID : 28127536. ] [ This corrects the article on p. 242 in vol. 46 , PMID : 27478801. ] . Objective : The purpose of this study was to develop superimposition method on the lower arch using 3-dimensional ( 3D ) cone beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images and orthodontic 3D digital modeling. Methods : Integrated 3D CBCT images were acquired by substituting the dental portion of 3D CBCT images with precise dental images of an orthodontic 3D digital model. Images were acquired before and after treatment. For the superimposition , 2 superimposition methods were designed. Surface superimposition was based on the basal bone structure of the mandible by surface-to-surface matching ( best-fit method ) . Plane superimposition was based on anatomical structures ( mental and lingual foramen ) . For the evaluation , 10 landmarks including teeth and anatomic structures were assigned , and 30 times of superimpositions and measurements were performed to determine the more reproducible and reliable method. Results : All landmarks demonstrated that the surface superimposition method produced relatively more consistent coordinate values. The mean distances of measured landmarks values from the means were statistically significantly lower with the surface superimpositions method. Conclusions : Between the 2 superimposition methods designed for the evaluation of 3D changes in the lower arch , surface superimposition was the simpler , more reproducible , reliable method . The purpose of the current report is to present 6-year long-term stability and 10-year follow-up data for an adult patient who was treated with a tongue elevator for relapsed anterior open-bite. The 19-year-old male patient presented with the chief complaint of difficulty in chewing his food. Collectively , clinical and radiographic examinations revealed an anterior open-bite , low tongue posture , and tongue-tie. The patient opted for orthodontic treatment alone , without any surgical procedure. A lingual frenectomy was recommended to avoid the risk of relapse , but the patient declined because he was not experiencing tongue discomfort. Initial treatment of the anterior open-bite with molar intrusion and tongue exercises was successful , but relapse occurred during the retention period. A tongue elevator was used for retreatment , because the approach was minimally invasive and suited the patient 's requirements regarding discomfort , cost , and time. The appliance changed the tongue posture and generated an altered tongue force , which ultimately resulted in intrusive dentoalveolar effects , and a subsequent counterclockwise rotation of the mandible. The results showed long-term stability and were maintained for six years through continual use of the tongue elevator. The results of this case indicated that a tongue elevator could be used not only as an alternative treatment for open-bite , but also as an active retainer . Objective : The purpose of this study was to compare the treatment duration and dentoskeletal changes between two different anchorage systems used to treat maxillary dentoalveolar protrusion and to examine the effectiveness of en-masse retraction using two miniscrews placed in the midpalatal suture. Methods : Fifty-seven patients ( 9 men , 48 women ) , who had undergone level anchorage system treatment at Aichi-Gakuin University Dental Hospital ( Nagoya , Japan ) were divided into two groups according to the method of maxillary posterior anchorage reinforcement : midpalatal miniscrews ( 25 patients , mean age 22 years ) and conventional anchorage ( 32 patients , mean age 19 years ) . The en-masse retraction period , overall treatment duration , pre-treatment effective ANB angle , and change in the effective ANB angle were compared with an independent-samples t-test. Results : Compared to the headgear group , the duration of en-masse retraction was longer by approximately 4 months in the miniscrew group ( p < 0.001 ) . However , we found no significant difference in the total treatment duration between the groups. Moreover , a greater change in the effective ANB angle was observed in patients treated with miniscrews than in those treated with the conventional method ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : The level anchorage system treatment using miniscrews placed in the midpalatal area will allow orthodontists more time to control the anterior teeth during en-masse retraction , without increasing the total treatment duration. Furthermore , it achieves better dentoskeletal control than does the conventional anchorage method , thereby improving the quality of the treatment results . Objective : Orthodontic mini-implants ( OMI ) generate various horizontal and vertical force vectors and moments according to their insertion positions. This study aimed to help select ideal biomechanics during maxillary incisor retraction by varying the length in the anterior retraction hook ( ARH ) and OMI position. Methods : Two extraction models were constructed to analyze the three-dimentional finite element : a first premolar extraction model ( Model 1 , M1 ) and a residual 1-mm space post-extraction model ( Model 2 , M2 ) . The OMI position was set at a height of 8 mm from the arch wire between the second maxillary premolar and the first molar ( low OMI traction ) or at a 12-mm height in the mesial second maxillary premolar ( high OMI traction ) . Retraction force vectors of 200 g from the ARH ( -1 , +1 , +3 , and +6 mm ) at low or high OMI traction were resolved into X- , Y- , and Z-axis components. Results : In M1 ( low and high OMI traction ) and M2 ( low OMI traction ) , the maxillary incisor tip was extruded , but the apex was intruded , and the occlusal plane was rotated clockwise. Significant intrusion and counter-clockwise rotation in the occlusal plane were observed under high OMI traction and -1 mm ARH in M2. Conclusions : This study observed orthodontic tooth movement according to the OMI position and ARH height , and M2 under high OMI traction with short ARH showed retraction with maxillary incisor intrusion . Objective : To compare dentoalveolar and skeletal changes produced by the pendulum appliance ( PA ) and the distal screw appliance ( DS ) in Class II patients. Methods : Forty-three patients ( 19 men , 24 women ) with Class II malocclusion were retrospectively selected for the study. Twenty-four patients ( mean age , 12.2 ± 1.5 years ) were treated with the PA , and 19 patients ( mean age , 11.3 ± 1.9 years ) were treated with the DS. The mean distalization time was 7 months for the PA group and 9 months for the DS group. Lateral cephalograms were obtained at T1 , before treatment , and at T2 , the end of distalization. A Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical comparisons of the two groups between T1 and T2. Results : PA and DS were equally effective in distalizing maxillary molars ( 4.7 mm and 4.2 mm , respectively ) between T1 and T2 ; however , the maxillary first molars showed less distal tipping in the DS group than in the PA group ( 3.2° vs. 9.0° , respectively ) . Moreover , significant premolar anchorage loss ( 2.7 mm ) and incisor proclination ( 5.0° ) were noted in the PA group , whereas premolar distal movement ( 1.9 mm ) and no significant changes at the incisor ( 0.1° ) were observed in the DS group. No significant sagittal or vertical skeletal changes were detected between the two groups during the distalization phase. Conclusions : PA and DS seem to be equally effective in distalizing maxillary molars ; however , greater distal molar tipping and premolar anchorage loss can be expected using PA . Objective : To compare condylar position and morphology among different vertical skeletal patterns. Methods : Diagnostic cone-beam computed tomography images of 60 adult patients ( 120 temporomandibular joints ) who visited the orthodontic clinic of Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital were reviewed. The subjects were divided into three equal groups according to the mandibular plane angle : hypodivergent , normodivergent , and hyperdivergent groups. Morphology of the condyle and mandibular fossa and condylar position were compared among the groups. Results : The hypodivergent and hyperdivergent groups showed significant differences in superior joint spaces , antero-posterior condyle width , medio-lateral condyle width , condyle head angle , and condylar shapes. Conclusions : Condylar position and morphology vary according to vertical facial morphology. This relationship should be considered for predicting and establishing a proper treatment plan for temporomandibular diseases during orthodontic treatment . Objective : To investigate skeletal and dental changes after application of a mandibular setback surgery-first orthodontic treatment approach in cases of skeletal Class III malocclusion. Methods : A retrospective study of 34 patients ( 23 men , 11 women ; mean age , 26.2 ± 6.6 years ) with skeletal Class III deformities , who underwent surgery-first orthodontic treatment , was conducted. Skeletal landmarks in the maxilla and mandible at three time points , pre-treatment ( T0 ) , immediate-postoperative ( T1 ) , and post-treatment ( T2 ) , were analyzed using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) -generated half-cephalograms. Results : The significant T0 to T1 mandibular changes occurred -9.24 ± 3.97 mm horizontally. From T1 to T2 , the mandible tended to move forward 1.22 ± 2.02 mm , while the condylar position ( Cd to Po-perpendicular plane ) shifted backward , and the coronoid process ( Cp to FH plane ) moved vertically. Between T1 and T2 , the vertical dimension changed significantly ( p < 0.05 ) . Changes in the vertical dimension were significantly correlated to T1 to T2 changes in the Cd to Po-perpendicular plane ( r = -0.671 , p = 0.034 ) , and in the Cp to FH plane ( r = 0.733 , p = 0.016 ) , as well as to T0 to T1 changes in the Cp to Po-perpendicular plane ( r = 0.758 , p = 0.011 ) . Conclusions : Greater alterations in the vertical dimension caused larger post-treatment ( T2 ) stage skeletal changes. Studying the mandibular position in relation to the post-surgical vertical dimension emphasized the integral importance of vertical dimension control and proximal segment management to the success of surgery-first orthodontic treatment . Orthodontic treatment of a complex case that involves retained deciduous mandibular second molars with missing permanent successors is challenging. Usually , congenitally missing teeth are manifested with other dental anomalies that further complicate orthodontic treatment , such as retained deciduous teeth , impactions , transpositions and peg-shaped lateral incisors. Even though the long term prognosis of the retained deciduous tooth is not fully predictable , if the teeth are in good condition , the patient and clinician may incline towards a decision to preserve the deciduous teeth as long as possible. This case report demonstrates that deciduous teeth , in this case the mandibular second molars and maxillary canine , can be incorporated into final occlusion with clinically stable long-term results . Objective : The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of Bolton analysis obtained from digital models scanned with the Ortho Insight three-dimensional ( 3D ) laser scanner system to those obtained from cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) images and traditional plaster models. Methods : CBCT scans and plaster models were obtained from 50 patients. Plaster models were scanned using the Ortho Insight 3D laser scanner ; Bolton ratios were calculated with its software. CBCT scans were imported and analyzed using AVIZO software. Plaster models were measured with a digital caliper. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and the intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) . Results : Anterior and overall Bolton ratios obtained by the three different modalities exhibited excellent agreement ( > 0.970 ) . The mean differences between the scanned digital models and physical models and between the CBCT images and scanned digital models for overall Bolton ratios were 0.41 ± 0.305 % and 0.45 ± 0.456 % , respectively ; for anterior Bolton ratios , 0.59 ± 0.520 % and 1.01 ± 0.780 % , respectively. ICC results showed that intraexaminer error reliability was generally excellent ( > 0.858 for all three diagnostic modalities ) , with < 1.45 % discrepancy in the Bolton analysis. Conclusions : Laser scanned digital models are highly accurate compared to physical models and CBCT scans for assessing the spatial relationships of dental arches for orthodontic diagnosis . A 12-year-old girl was referred to our clinic for evaluation of an unaesthetic dental appearance. All permanent teeth were erupted , while the deciduous maxillary right canine was retained. Cone-beam computed tomography revealed a complete transposition of the maxillary left canine and first premolar involving both the crowns and the roots. Initial cephalometric analysis showed a skeletal Class III pattern , with a slight maxillary retrusion and a compensated proclination of the upper incisors. The patient 's teeth were considered to be in the correct position ; therefore , we decided to attempt treatment by correcting the transposition and using only orthodontic compensation of the skeletal Class III malocclusion. After 25 months of active orthodontic treatment , the patient had a Class I molar and canine relationship on both sides , with ideal overbite and overjet values. Her profile was improved , her lips were competent , and cephalometric evaluation showed acceptable maxillary and mandibular incisor inclinations. The final panoramic radiograph showed that good root parallelism was achieved. Two-year follow-up intraoral photography showed stable results . Objective : To compare the positions of the mandibular premolars in Angle Class I subjects according to vertical facial type. The results will provide a theoretical basis for predicting effective tooth movement in orthodontic treatment. Methods : Cephalometric parameters were determined using cone-beam computed tomography in 120 Angle Class I subjects. Subjects were categorized as short , normal , and long face types according to the Frankfort mandibular angle. Parameters indicating the position of the mandibular right premolars and the mandible were also measured. Results : The angle between the mandibular first premolar axis and buccal cortex , the distance between the root apex and buccal cortex , angle of vestibularization , arc of vestibularization , and root apex maximum movable distance were significantly greater in the short face type than in the long and norm face types. The angle between the mandibular second premolar axis and buccal cortex , the distance from root apex to buccal cortex , and the arc of vestibularization were significantly greater in the short face type than in the normal face type. Conclusions : There are significant differences in the mandibular premolar positions in Class I subjects according to vertical facial type . Objective : To evaluate transverse skeletal and dental changes , including those in the buccolingual dental axis , between patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry after bilateral intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy with and without presurgical orthodontic treatment. Methods : This retrospective study included 29 patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry including menton deviation > 4 mm from the midsagittal plane. To evaluate changes in transverse skeletal and dental variables ( i.e. , buccolingual inclination of the upper and lower canines and first molars ) , the data for 16 patients who underwent conventional orthognathic surgery ( CS ) were compared with those for 13 patients who underwent preorthodontic orthognathic surgery ( POGS ) , using three-dimensional computed tomography at initial examination , 1 month before surgery , and at 7 days and 1 year after surgery. Results : The 1-year postsurgical examination revealed no significant changes in the postoperative transverse dental axis in the CS group. In the POGS group , the upper first molar inclined lingually on both sides ( deviated side , -1.8° ± 2.8° , p= 0.044 ; nondeviated side , -3.7° ± 3.3° , p= 0.001 ) and the lower canine inclined lingually on the nondeviated side ( 4.0° ± 5.4° , p= 0.022 ) during postsurgical orthodontic treatment. There were no significant differences in the skeletal and dental variables between the two groups at 1 year after surgery. Conclusions : POGS may be a clinically acceptable alternative to CS as a treatment to achieve stable transverse axes of the dentition in both arches in patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry . Objective : We evaluated the detachment force , amount of deformation , fracture mode , and pull-out force of 3 different wires used for bonded lingual retainer fabrication. Methods : We tested 0.0215-inch five-stranded wire ( PentaOne , Masel ; group I ) , 0.016 _ 0.022-inch dead-soft eight-braided wire ( Bond-A-Braid , Reliance ; group II ) , and 0.0195-inch dead-soft coaxial wire ( Respond , Ormco ; group III ) . To test detachment force , deformation , and fracture mode , we embedded 94 lower incisor teeth in acrylic blocks in pairs. Retainer wires were bonded to the teeth and vertically directed force was applied to the wire. To test pull-out force , wires were embedded in composite that was placed in a hole at the center of an acrylic block. Tensile force was applied along the long axis of the wire. Results : Detachment force and mode of fracture were not different between groups. Deformation was significantly higher in groups II and III than in group I ( p < 0.001 ) . Mean pull-out force was significantly higher for group I compared to groups II and III ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : Detachment force and fracture mode were similar for all wires , but greater deformations were seen in dead-soft wires. Wire pull-out force was significantly higher for five-stranded coaxial wire than for the other wires tested. Five-stranded coaxial wires are suggested for use in bonded lingual retainers . In this report , we describe a case involving a 34-year-old woman who showed good treatment outcomes with long-term stability after multidisciplinary treatment for unilateral cleft lip and palate ( CLP ) , maxillary hypoplasia , severe maxillary arch constriction , severe occlusal collapse , and gingival recession. A comprehensive treatment approach was developed with maximum consideration of strong scar constriction and gingival recession ; it included minimum maxillary arch expansion , maxillary advancement by distraction osteogenesis using an internal distraction device , and mandibular setback using sagittal split ramus osteotomy. Her post-treatment records demonstrated a balanced facial profile and occlusion with improved facial symmetry. The patient 's profile was dramatically improved , with reduced upper lip retrusion and lower lip protrusion as a result of the maxillary advancement and mandibular setback , respectively. Although gingival recession showed a slight increase , tooth mobility was within the normal physiological range. No tooth hyperesthesia was observed after treatment. There was negligible osseous relapse , and the occlusion remained stable after 5 years of post-treatment retention. Our findings suggest that such multidisciplinary approaches for the treatment of CLP with gingival recession and occlusal collapse help in improving occlusion and facial esthetics without the need for prostheses such as dental implants or bridges ; in addition , the results show long-term post-treatment stability . Objective : The aim of this study was to compare the effects of different enamel conditioning techniques for bracket bonding. Methods : Ninety-one human premolars were randomly divided in six groups of 15 specimens each. The enamel surfaces of the teeth were etched with 35 % orthophosphoric acid in Group 1 , with a self-etching primer in Group 2 , sandblasted in Group 3 , sandblasted and etched with 35 % orthophosphoric acid in Group 4 , conditioned by Er : YAG laser in Group 5 and conditioned by Er : YAG laser and etched with 35 % phosphoric acid gel respectively in Group 6. After enamel conditioning procedures , brackets were bonded and shear bonding test was performed. After debonding , adhesive remnant index scores were calculated for all groups. One tooth from each group were inspected by scanning electron microscope for evaluating the enamel surface characteristics. Results : The laser and acid etched group showed the highest mean shear bond strength ( SBS ) value ( 13.61 ± 1.14 MPa ) while sandblasted group yielded the lowest value ( 3.12 ± 0.61 MPa ) . Conclusions : Although the SBS values were higher , the teeth in laser conditioned groups were highly damaged. Therefore , acid etching and self-etching techniques were found to be safer for orthodontic bracket bonding. Sandblasting method was found to generate inadequate bonding strength . Objective : In this study , we measured the cortical bone thickness in the mandibular buccal and lingual areas using computed tomography in order to evaluate the suitability of these areas for application of temporary anchorage devices ( TADs ) and to suggest a clinical guide for TADs. Methods : The buccal and lingual cortical bone thickness was measured in 15 men and 15 women. Bone thickness was measured 4 mm apical to the interdental cementoenamel junction between the mandibular canine and the 2nd molar using the transaxial slices in computed tomography images. Results : The cortical bone in the mandibular buccal and lingual areas was thicker in men than in women. In men , the mandibular lingual cortical bone was thicker than the buccal cortical bone , except between the 1st and 2nd molars on both sides. In women , the mandibular lingual cortical bone was thicker in all regions when compared to the buccal cortical bone. The mandibular buccal cortical bone thickness increased from the canine to the molars. The mandibular lingual cortical bone was thickest between the 1st and 2nd premolars , followed by the areas between the canine and 1st premolar , between the 2nd premolar and 1st molar , and between the 1st molar and 2nd molar. Conclusions : There is sufficient cortical bone for TAD applications in the mandibular buccal and lingual areas. This provides the basis and guidelines for the clinical use of TADs in the mandibular buccal and lingual areas . This article reports the orthodontic treatment of a patient with skeletal mandibular retrusion and an anterior open bite due to temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis ( TMJ-OA ) using miniscrew anchorage. A 46-year-old woman had a Class II malocclusion with a retropositioned mandible. Her overjet and overbite were 7.0 mm and -1.6 mm , respectively. She had limited mouth opening , TMJ sounds , and pain. Condylar resorption was observed in both TMJs. Her TMJ pain was reduced by splint therapy , and then orthodontic treatment was initiated. Titanium miniscrews were placed at the posterior maxilla to intrude the molars. After 2 years and 7 months of orthodontic treatment , an acceptable occlusion was achieved without any recurrence of TMJ symptoms. The retropositioned mandible was considerably improved , and the lips showed less tension upon lip closure. The maxillary molars were intruded by 1.5 mm , and the mandible was subsequently rotated counterclockwise. Magnetic resonance imaging of both condyles after treatment showed avascular necrosis-like structures. During a 2-year retention period , an acceptable occlusion was maintained without recurrence of the open bite. In conclusion , correction of open bite and clockwise-rotated mandible through molar intrusion using titanium miniscrews is effective for the management of TMJ-OA with jaw deformity . This article describes the orthodontic treatment of a 25-year-old Korean female patient with anterior crowding , including palatally displaced lateral incisors. Her facial profile was satisfactory , but 3.5 mm of maxillary anterior crowding was observed. To correct this crowding , we decided to minimize the use of the conventional fixed orthodontic appliances and employed a less bulky and more aesthetic appliance for applying light continuous force. We determined the final positions of the maxillary teeth via a working model for diagnostic set up and achieved space gaining and alignment with simple Ni-Ti spring and stainless steel round tubes. Tooth alignment was achieved efficiently and aesthetically without the conventional brackets . Objective : To determine the effect of surface anodization on the interfacial strength between an orthodontic microimplant ( MI ) and the rabbit tibial bone , particularly in the initial phase after placement. Methods : A total of 36 MIs were driven into the tibias of 3 mature rabbits by using the self-drilling method and then removed after 6 weeks. Half the MIs were as-machined ( n = 18 ; machined group ) , while the remaining had anodized surfaces ( n = 18 ; anodized group ) . The peak insertion torque ( PIT ) and the peak removal torque ( PRT ) values were measured for the 2 groups of MIs. These values were then used to calculate the interfacial shear strength between the MI and cortical bone. Results : There were no statistical differences in terms of PIT between the 2 groups. However , mean PRT was significantly greater for the anodized implants ( 3.79 ± 1.39 Ncm ) than for the machined ones ( 2.05 ± 1.07 Ncm ) ( p < 0.01 ) . The interfacial strengths , converted from PRT , were calculated at 10.6 MPa and 5.74 MPa for the anodized and machined group implants , respectively. Conclusions : Anodization of orthodontic MIs may enhance their early-phase retention capability , thereby ensuring a more reliable source of absolute anchorage . Objective : This study was designed to define the Korean norm values for the Ricketts analysis. Methods : In this longitudinal study , lateral cephalograms of 31 subjects with normal occlusion were taken biennially from ages 9-19 years. Cephalometric measurements were performed. Parameters for which the 10-year change did not exceed one standard deviation were defined as unchanged. The means and standard deviations for the measured parameters were determined for each age group. Results : No significant changes in growth were observed in the molar relationship , incisor overjet , incisor overbite , mandibular incisor extrusion , interincisor angle , lower incisor tip ( B1 ) to A point-Pogonion ( A-PO ) plane , upper incisor tip ( A1 ) to A-PO plane , B1 inclination to A-PO , A1 inclination to A-PO , B1 inclination to Frankfurt plane ( FH ) , convexity , lower facial height , facial axis , maxillary depth , maxillary height , palatal plane to FH , cranial deflection , ramus Xi position , or porion location. Continual changes over the 10 years of growth were observed in the maxillary first molar distal position to pterygoid true vertical plane , facial depth , mandibular plane to FH , anterior cranial length , mandibular arc , and corpus length. Conclusions : Clinicians can apply the Korean norms at age 9 as determined in this study when using the Ricketts analysis. The patient 's age at the beginning of treatment and their sex should be taken into consideration when drawing visual treatment objectives . Single-tooth implantation has become a common treatment solution for replacement of a root-fractured maxillary incisor in adults , but the long-term esthetic results can be unfavorable due to progressive marginal bone loss , resulting in gingival recession. In this case report , a maxillary central incisor with a root fracture in its apical one-third was orthodontically extruded and extracted in a 21-year-old female. Implant surgery was performed after a 3-month healing period , and the final crown was placed about 12 months after extraction. After 12 years , favorable osseous and gingival architectures were visible with adequate bone height and thickness at the buccal cortical plate , and no gingival recession was seen around the implant-supported crown. Although modern dentistry has been shifting toward simplified , clinical procedures and shorter treatment times , both general dentists and orthodontists should be aware of the possible long-term esthetic advantages of orthodontic extrusion of hopelessly fractured teeth for highly esthetically demanding areas and should educate and motivate patients regarding the choice of this treatment solution , if necessary . Objective : The aims of this study were to use a 3-dimensional ( 3D ) system to compare molar relationship assessments performed from the buccal and lingual aspects , and to measure differences in occlusal contact areas between Class II and Class I molar relationships. Methods : Study casts ( 232 pairs from 232 subjects , yielding a total of 380 sides ) were evaluated from both the buccal and lingual aspects , so that molar relationships could be classified according to the scheme devised by Liu and Melsen. Occlusal contact areas were quantified using 3D digital models , which were generated through surface scanning of the study casts. Results : A cusp-to-central fossa relationship was observed from the lingual aspect in the majority of cases classified from the buccal aspect as Class I ( 89.6 % ) or mild Class II ( 86.7 % ) . However , severe Class II cases had lingual cusp-to-mesial triangular fossa or marginal ridge relationships. Mean occlusal contact areas were similar in the Class I and mild Class II groups , while the severe Class II group had significantly lower values than either of the other 2 groups ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Buccal and lingual assessments of molar relationships were not always consistent. Occlusal contact areas were lowest for the Class II-severe group , which seems to have the worst molar relationships - especially as seen from the lingual aspect . Objective : This study aimed to propose clinical guidelines for placing miniscrew implants using the results obtained from 3-dimensional analysis of maxillary anterior interdental alveolar bone by cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) . Methods : By using CBCT data from 52 adult patients ( 17 men and 35 women ; mean age , 27.9 years ) , alveolar bone were measured in 3 regions : between the maxillary central incisors ( U1-U1 ) , between the maxillary central incisor and maxillary lateral incisor ( U1-U2 ) , and between the maxillary lateral incisor and the canine ( U2-U3 ) . Cortical bone thickness , labio-palatal thickness , and interdental root distance were measured at 4 mm , 6 mm , and 8 mm apical to the interdental cementoenamel junction ( ICEJ ) . Results : The cortical bone thickness significantly increased from the U1-U1 region to the U2-U3 region ( p < 0.05 ) . The labio-palatal thickness was significantly less in the U1-U1 region ( p < 0.05 ) , and the interdental root distance was significantly less in the U1-U2 region ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : The results of this study suggest that the interdental root regions U2-U3 and U1-U1 are the best sites for placing miniscrew implants into maxillary anterior alveolar bone . Objective : The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the in vivo effects of prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) administered by different methods on orthodontic tooth movement and bone metabolism macroscopically , histopatologically , and biochemically. Methods : Forty-five young adult New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into 3 experimental groups ( n = 10/group ) , 1 positive control group ( n = 10 ) , and 1 negative control group ( n = 5 ) . The experimental rabbits were fitted with springs exerting 20-g reciprocal force on the maxillary incisors and PGE2 ( 10 µg/mL ) was administered by the intravenous , submucosal , or intraligamentous route after appliance insertion and on days 1 , 3 , 7 , and 14 thereafter. All rabbits were sacrificed on day 21 and their premaxillae were resected for histologic evaluation. Results : Tooth movement was observed in the experimental and positive control groups , but the intraligamentous PGE2 group had the highest values of all analyzed parameters , including serum calcium and phosphorus levels and osteoclastic and osteoblastic populations ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : Submucosal and intraligamentous PGE2 administration significantly increases orthodontic tooth movement and bone metabolism , but the intraligamentous route seems to be more effective .

Objective : The purpose of this study was to assess new three-dimensional ( 3D ) cephalometric variables , and to evaluate the relationships among skeletal and dentoalveolar variables through 3D cephalometric analysis. Methods : Cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) scans were acquired from 38 young adults ( 18 men and 20 women ; 22.6 ± 3.2 years ) with normal occlusion. Thirty-five landmarks were digitized on the 3D-rendered views. Several measurements were obtained for selected landmarks. Correlations among different variables were calculated by means of Pearson 's correlation coefficient values. Results : The body of the mandible had a longer curve length in men ( 102.3 ± 4.4 mm ) than in women ( 94.5 ± 4.7 mm ) ( p < 0.001 ) , but there was no significant difference in the maxillary basal curve length. Men had significantly larger facial dimensions , whereas women had a larger gonial angle ( 117.0 ± 4.0 vs. 113.8 ± 3.3 ; p < 0.001 ) . Strong-to-moderate correlation values were found among the vertical and transverse variables ( r = 0.71 to 0.51 ) . Conclusions : The normative values of new 3D cephalometric parameters , including the maxillary and mandibular curve length , were obtained. Strong-to-moderate correlation values were found among several vertical and transverse variables through 3D cephalometric analysis. This method of cephalometric analyses can be useful in diagnosis and treatment planning for patients with dentofacial deformities . In this report , we present the case of a girl with delayed odontogenesis of a lower second premolar for which she was followed up for 8.5 years. Congenital absence of permanent mandibular second premolars was observed at the initial radiographic examination at 8 years and 1 month. One year later , during the treatment period , an unexpected odontogenesis of a right second premolar was diagnosed on follow-up radiography. The original treatment plan was revised and a new plan was successfully implemented. Th is unusual case showed that the orthodontist 's clinical philosophy must be flexible because unexpected situations can arise , especially when treating growing patients . In the correction of dental Class III molar relationship in skeletal Class II patients , uprighting of the mandibular posterior segments without opening the mandible is an important treatment objective. In the case reported herein , a C-tube miniplate fixed to the lower labial symphysis and connected with a nickel-titanium reverse-curved archwire provided effective uprighting of the lower molars , without the need of orthodontic appliances on the mandibular anteriors. Using this approach , an appropriate magnitude of force is exerted on the molars while avoiding any negative effect on the mandibular anteriors . Objective : To test the null hypothesis that SmartClip self-ligating brackets are more effective than conventional brackets for initial mandibular alignment and identify influential factors. Methods : Fifty patients were randomly allocated to two equal treatment groups by using an online randomization program : self-ligating group ( SmartClip brackets ) and conventional group ( Gemini brackets ) . The archwire sequence was standardized. Changes in anterior irregularity index , intercanine width , and intermolar width were assessed on plaster models at 8th and 16th weeks. Changes in incisor position and inclination were assessed on lateral cephalometric radiographs at 16 weeks. Intragroup and intergroup comparisons were performed with paired t-test and Student 's t-test , respectively. Multiple linear regression was performed to identify variables affecting improvement in anterior ambiguity. Results : Data of 46 patients were analyzed ; those missing an appointment ( n = 2 ) or showing bracket breakage ( n = 2 ) were excluded. Incisor inclination ( p < 0.05 ) , intercanine width ( p < 0.05 ) , and intermolar width ( p > 0.05 ) increased at 8 and 16 weeks in both the groups ; no significant intergroup differences were noted ( p > 0.05 ) . Initial anterior irregularity index and intercanine width change were significantly associated with improvement in anterior irregularity ( p < 0.001 ) . Conclusions : The null hypothesis was rejected. Bracket type has little effect on improvement in anterior ambiguity during initial mandibular alignment . Objective : To analyze the fatigue resistance , debonding force , and failure type of fiber-reinforced composite , polyethylene ribbon-reinforced , and braided stainless steel wire lingual retainers in vitro. Methods : Roots of human mandibular central incisors were covered with silicone , mimicking the periodontal ligament , and embedded in polymethylmethacrylate. The specimens ( N = 50 ) , with two teeth each , were randomly divided into five groups ( n = 10/group ) according to the retainer materials : ( 1 ) Interlig ( E-glass ) , ( 2 ) everStick Ortho ( E-glass ) , ( 3 ) DentaPreg Splint ( S2-glass ) , ( 4 ) Ribbond ( polyethylene ) , and ( 5 ) Quad Cat wire ( stainless steel ) . After the recommended adhesive procedures , the retainers were bonded to the teeth by using flowable composite resin ( Tetric Flow ) . The teeth were subjected to 10,00,000 cyclic loads ( 8 Hz , 3 - 100 N , 45° angle , under 37 ± 3 water ) at their incisoproximal contact , and debonding forces were measured with a universal testing machine ( 1 mm/min crosshead speed ) . Failure sites were examined under a stereomicroscope ( _40 magnification ) . Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Results : All the specimens survived the cyclic loading. Their mean debonding forces were not significantly different ( p > 0.05 ) . The DentaPreg Splint group ( 80 % ) showed the highest incidence of complete adhesive debonding , followed by the Interlig group ( 60 % ) . The everStick Ortho group ( 80 % ) presented predominantly partial adhesive debonding. The Quad Cat wire group ( 50 % ) presented overlying composite detachment. Conclusions : Cyclic loading did not cause debonding. The retainers presented similar debonding forces but different failure types. Braided stainless steel wire retainers presented the most repairable failure type . Objective : We aimed to compare the retention characteristics of Essix and Hawley retainers. Methods : Adolescents undergoing fixed appliance treatment at 2 centers were recruited for this study. Twenty-two patients ( 16 women and 6 men ) wore Essix retainers ( Essix group ) while 20 ( 14 women and 6 men ) wore Hawley retainers ( Hawley group ) . The mean retention time was 1 year , and the mean follow-up recall time for both groups was 2 years. Two qualified dental examiners evaluated the blind patient data. Maxillary and mandibular dental casts and lateral cephalograms were analyzed at 4 stages : pretreatment ( T1 ) , post-treatment ( T2 ) , post-retention ( T3 ) , and follow-up ( T4 ) . Results : The results revealed that Essix appliances were more efficient in retaining the anterior teeth in the mandible during a 1-year retention period. The irregularity index increased in both arches in both groups after a 2-year post-retention period. The mandibular arch lengths increased during treatment and tended to return to their original value after retention in both groups ; however , these changes were statistically significant only in the Hawley group. Cephalometric variables did not show any significant differences. Conclusions : The retention characteristics of both Essix and Hawley retainers are similar . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate displacement of the mandibular condyle after orthognathic surgery using a condylar-repositioning device. Methods : The patient group comprised 20 adults who underwent bimaxillary surgery between August 2008 and July 2011. The degree of condylar displacement was measured by pre- and postoperative tomographic analysis using centric relation bite and a wire during surgery. A survey assessing temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) sound , pain , and locking was performed. The 20 tomographs and surveys were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and McNemar 's test , respectively. Results : No significant changes were observed in the anterior , superior , or posterior joint space of the TMJ ( p > 0.05 ) . In addition , no significant change was observed in TMJ sound ( p > 0.05 ) . However , TMJ pain and locking both decreased significantly after surgery ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Due to its simplicity , this method may be feasible and useful for repositioning condyles . Objective : The aims of this study were to examine whether a passive stretch stimulus by means of a functional appliance induces changes in the fiber composition of masticatory muscles and whether these changes are similar to the changes in stretched limb muscle fibers by using RT-PCR , western blot , and immunohistochemical assays. Methods : Five male New Zealand White rabbits were fitted with a prefabricated inclined plane on the maxillary central incisors to force the mandible forward ( - 2 mm ) and downward ( - 4 mm ) . Further , 1 hind limb was extended and constrained with a cast so that the extensor digitorum longus ( EDL ) was stretched when the animal used the limb. The animals were sacrificed after 1 week and the masseter , lateral pterygoid , and EDL were processed and compared with those from control animals ( n = 3 ) . Results : The stretched EDL had a significantly higher percentage of slow fibers , whereas the stretched masticatory muscles did not show changes in the composition of the major contractile proteins after 7 days. Conclusions : The transition of fiber phenotypes in response to a stretch stimulus may take longer in the masticatory muscles than in the limb muscles . Objective : The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the mandibular dental and basal arch forms in subjects with normal occlusion and compare them with those of Class III malocclusion using cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) . Methods : CBCT images of 32 normal occlusion ( 19 males , 13 females ; 24.3 years ) and 33 Class III malocclusion subjects ( 20 males , 13 females , 22.2 years ) were selected. Facial axis and root center points were identified from the left to right mandibular first molars. Distances between the facial axis and root center points for each tooth were calculated , and 4 linear and 2 ratio variables were measured and calculated for each arch form. The variables were compared between groups by independent t-test. Pearson correlation coefficient was applied to assess the relationships between dental and basal variables within each group. Results : The mandibular dental and basal intercanine widths were significantly greater in the Class III group than in normal occlusion subjects ( p < 0.05 ) . The dental and basal intercanine widths as well as the dental and basal intermolar widths were strongly correlated in normal occlusion and moderately correlated in Class III malocclusion. Conclusions : The dental arch form demon strated a strong positive correlation with the basal arch form in the normal occlusion group and moderate correlation in the Class III malocclusion group. These results might be helpful for clinicians to have a better understanding of the importance of basal arch form in the alveolar bone . Objective : The aim of this study was to assess artifacts induced by metallic restorations in three-dimensional ( 3D ) dental surface models derived by cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) . Methods : Fifteen specimens , each with four extracted human premolars and molars embedded in a plaster block , were scanned by CBCT before and after the cavitated second premolars were restored with dental amalgam. Five consecutive surface models of each specimen were created according to increasing restoration size : no restoration ( control ) and small occlusal , large occlusal , disto-occlusal , and mesio-occluso-distal restorations. After registering each restored model with the control model , maximum linear discrepancy , area , and intensity of the artifacts were measured and compared. Results : Artifacts developed mostly on the buccal and lingual surfaces. They occurred not only on the second premolar but also on the first premolar and first molar. The parametric values increased significantly with increasing restoration size. Conclusions : Metallic restorations induce considerable artifacts in 3D dental surface models. Artifact reduction should be taken into consideration for a proper diagnosis and treatment planning when using 3D surface model derived by CBCT in dentofacial deformity patients . An 8-years old boy with facial asymmetry and unilateral posterior crossbite on the left side received orthopedic and orthodontic treatment. During the first phase of treatment , the narrow maxillary arch was expanded using an acrylic plate. Then , the acrylic plate was used as a bite block with occlusal indentations from the construction bite that was obtained with the incisors in a coincident dental midline. After the position of the mandible was stabilized , the second phase of orthodontic treatment was initiated using fixed appliances for detailing of the occlusion. Skeletal symmetry , ideal occlusion , and coincident dental midlines were thus achieved. Functionally , occlusal force balance and masticatory muscle activity were improved , and the chewing patterns were normalized . This article describes the orthodontic treatment of a 31-year-old Korean female patient with gummy smile and crowding. The patient showed excessive gingival display in both the anterior and posterior areas and a large difference in gingival heights between the anterior and posterior teeth in the maxilla. To correct the gummy smile , we elected to intrude the entire maxillary dentition instead of focusing only on the maxillary anterior teeth. Alignment and leveling were performed , and a midpalatal absolute anchorage system as well as a modified lingual arch was designed to achieve posterosuperior movement of the entire upper dentition. The active treatment period was 18 months. The gummy smile and crowding were corrected , and the results were stable at 21 months post-treatment . Objective : To compare three-dimensionally the midfacial hard- and soft-tissue asymmetries between the affected and the unaffected sides and determine the relationship between the hard tissue and the overlying soft tissue in patients with nonsyndromic complete unilateral cleft lip and palate ( UCLP ) by cone-beam computed tomography ( CBCT ) analysis. Methods : The maxillofacial regions of 26 adults ( 18 men , 8 women ) with nonsyndromic UCLP were scanned by CBCT and reconstructed by three-dimensional dental imaging. The frontal-view midfacial analysis was based on a 3 _ 3 grid of vertical and horizontal lines and their intersecting points. Two additional points were used for assessing the dentoalveolar area. Linear and surface measurements from three reference planes ( Basion-perpendicular , midsagittal reference , and Frankfurt horizontal planes ) to the intersecting points were used to evaluate the anteroposterior , transverse , and vertical asymmetries as well as convexity or concavity. Results : Anteroposteriorly , the soft tissue in the nasolabial and dentoalveolar regions was significantly thicker and positioned more anteriorly on the affected side than on the unaffected side ( p < 0.05 ) . The hard tissue in the dentoalveolar region was significantly retruded on the affected side compared with the unaffected side ( p < 0.05 ) . The other midfacial regions showed no significant differences. Conclusions : With the exception of the nasolabial and dentoalveolar regions , no distinctive midfacial hard- and soft-tissue asymmetries exist between the affected and the unaffected sides in patients with nonsyndromic UCLP . Objective : This study aimed to compare the frictional force ( FR ) in self-ligating brackets among different bracket-archwire angles , bracket materials , and archwire types. Methods : Passive and active metal self-ligating brackets and active ceramic self-ligating brackets were included as experimental groups , while conventional twin metal brackets served as a control group. All brackets were maxillary premolar brackets with 0.022 inch [ in ] slots and a -7° torque. The orthodontic wires used included 0.018 round and 0.019 _ 0.025 in rectangular stainless steel wires. The FR was measured at 0° , 5° , and 10° angulations as the wire was drawn through the bracket slots after attaching brackets from each group to the universal testing machine. Static and kinetic FRs were also measured. Results : The passive self-ligating brackets generated a lower FR than all the other brackets. Static and kinetic FRs generally increased with an increase in the bracket-archwire angulation , and the rectangular wire caused significantly higher static and kinetic FRs than the round wire ( p < 0.001 ) . The metal passive self-ligating brackets exhibited the lowest static FR at the 0° angulation and a lower increase in static and kinetic FRs with an increase in bracket-archwire angulation than the other brackets , while the conventional twin brackets showed a greater increase than all three experimental brackets. Conclusions : The passive self-ligating brackets showed the lowest FR in this study. Self-ligating brackets can generate varying FRs in vitro according to the wire size , surface characteristics , and bracket-archwire angulation . A 27-year-old man presented an anterior open bite relapse. He had low tongue posture positioned anteriorly at rest and during swallowing and reported chronic difficulty in nose breathing. Head cone-beam computed tomography revealed nasal septum deviation , right turbinate hypertrophy , and left maxillary sinus congestion , which were thought to contribute to the breathing problem , encourage the improper tongue posture , and thereby cause the relapse. Multidisciplinary treatment involving an otorhinolaryngologist , an orthodontist , and a periodontist resolved the upper airway obstruction and corrected the malocclusion. The follow-up examination after 3 years 5 months demonstrated stable results . Orthodontic closure of old , edentulous spaces in the mandibular posterior region is a major challenge. In this report , we describe a method of orthodontic closure of edentulous spaces in the mandibular posterior region accelerated by piezoelectric decortication and alveolar ridge expansion. Combined piezosurgical and orthodontic treatments were used to close 14- and 15-mm-wide spaces in the mandibular left and right posterior areas , respectively , of a female patient , aged 18 years and 9 months , diagnosed with skeletal Class III malocclusion , hypodontia , and polydiastemas. After the piezoelectric decortication , segmental and full-arch mechanics were applied in the orthodontic phase. Despite some extent of root resorption and anchorage loss , the edentulous spaces were closed , and adequate function and esthetics were regained without further restorative treatment. Alveolar ridge expansion-assisted orthodontic space closure seems to be an effective and relatively less-invasive treatment alternative for edentulous spaces in the mandibular posterior region . Objective : To investigate the resistance to sliding ( RS ) in self-ligating and conventional ligation bracket systems at 5 different second-order bracket angulations by using low-stiffness alignment wires in a 3-bracket experimental model and to verify the performance of the main RS components in both systems when these wires are used. Methods : Interactive self-ligating brackets with closed and open slides were used for the self-ligating ( SL ) and conventional ligation ( CL ) groups , respectively ; elastomeric ligatures ( 1 mm inner diameter ) were used in the latter system. The alignment wire used was 0.014 inch heat-activated NiTi ( austenitic finish temperature set at 36 by the manufacturer ) . A custom-made testing machine was used to measure frictional resistance. Tests were repeated 5 times at every angulation simulated. All data were analyzed statistically. Results : The RS increased significantly with increasing angulation in both SL and CL groups ( p < 0.0001 ) . However , the RS values were significantly higher at every angulation ( p < 0.0001 ) in the CL group. Conclusions : Despite the relevance of the binding phenomenon , ligation forces predominantly affect the RS when low-stiffness alignment wires are used . Because of the potential morbidity and complications associated with surgical procedures , limiting the extent of orthognathic surgery is a desire for many orthodontic patients. An eighteen-year-old woman had a severe Class III malocclusion and required bi-maxillary surgery. By changing the patient 's maxillary occlusal plane using orthodontic mini-implants , she was able to avoid the maxillary surgery ; requiring only a mandibular setback surgery. To accurately predict the post-surgery outcome , we applied a new soft tissue prediction method. We were able to follow and report the long-term result of her combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment. The changes to her occlusal plane continue to appear stable over 6 years later . Objective : The purpose of this study was to determine the soft tissue thickness of male and female orthodontic patients with different skeletal malocclusions. Methods : Soft tissue thickness measurements were made on lateral cephalometric radiographs of 180 healthy orthodontic patients with different skeletal malocclusions ( Class I : 60 subjects , Class II : 60 subjects , Class III : 60 subjects ) . Ten measurements were analyzed. For statistical evaluation , one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed. Least significant difference ( LSD ) and Dunnet T3 post hoc tests were used to determine the individual differences. Results : Soft tissue thicknesses were found to be greater for men than for women. Statistically significant differences among the skeletal groups were found in both men and women at the following sites : labrale superius , stomion , and labrale inferius. The thickness at the labrale superius and stomion points in each skeletal type was the greatest in Class III for both men and women. On the other hand , at the labrale inferius point , for both men and women , soft tissue depth was the least in Class III and the greatest in Class II. Conclusions : Soft tissue thickness differences among skeletal malocclusions were observed at the labrale superius , stomion , and labrale inferius sites for both men and women . Objective : This study investigated whether temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) condyle-fossa relationships are bilaterally symmetric in class III malocclusion patients with and without asymmetry and compared to those with normal occlusion. The hypothesis was a difference in condyle-fossa relationships exists in asymmetric patients. Methods : Group 1 comprised 40 Korean normal occlusion subjects. Groups 2 and 3 comprised patients diagnosed with skeletal class III malocclusion , who were grouped according to the presence of mandibular asymmetry : Group 2 included symmetric mandibles , while group 3 included asymmetric mandibles. Pretreatment three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography ( 3D CBCT ) images were obtained. Right- and left-sided TMJ spaces in groups 1 and 2 or deviated and non-deviated sides in group 3 were evaluated , and the axial condylar angle was compared. Results : The TMJ spaces demonstrated no significant bilateral differences in any group. Only group 3 had slightly narrower superior spaces ( p < 0.001 ) . The axial condylar angles between group 1 and 2 were not significant. However , group 3 showed a statistically significant bilateral difference ( p < 0.001 ) ; toward the deviated side , the axial condylar angle was steeper. Conclusions : Even in the asymmetric group , the TMJ spaces were similar between deviated and non-deviated sides , indicating a bilateral condyle-fossa relationship in patients with asymmetry that may be as symmetrical as that in patients with symmetry. However , the axial condylar angle had bilateral differences only in asymmetric groups. The mean TMJ space value and the bilateral difference may be used for evaluating condyle-fossa relationships with CBCT . A Brazilian girl aged 14 years and 9 months presented with a chief complaint of protrusive teeth. She had a convex facial profile , extreme overjet , deep bite , lack of passive lip seal , acute nasolabial angle , and retrognathic mandible. Intraorally , she showed maxillary diastemas , slight mandibular incisor crowding , a small maxillary arch , 13-mm overjet , and 4-mm overbite. After the diagnosis of severe Angle Class II division 1 malocclusion , a mandibular protraction appliance was placed to correct the Class II relationships and multiloop edgewise archwires were used for finishing. Follow-up examinations revealed an improved facial profile , normal overjet and overbite , and good intercuspation. The patient was satisfied with her occlusion , smile , and facial appearance. The excellent results suggest that orthodontic camouflage by using a mandibular protraction appliance in combination with the multiloop edgewise archwire technique is an effective option for correcting Class II malocclusions in patients who refuse orthognathic surgery . Objective : To evaluate lower incisor position and bony support between patients with Class II average- and high-angle malocclusions and compare with the patients presenting Class I malocclusions. Methods : CBCT records of 79 patients were divided into 2 groups according to sagittal jaw relationships : Class I and II. Each group was further divided into average- and high-angle subgroups. Six angular and 6 linear measurements were performed. Independent samples t-test , Kruskal-Wallis , and Dunn post-hoc tests were performed for statistical comparisons. Results : Labial alveolar bone thickness was significantly higher in Class I group compared to Class II group ( p = 0.003 ) . Lingual alveolar bone angle ( p = 0.004 ) , lower incisor protrusion ( p = 0.007 ) and proclination ( p = 0.046 ) were greatest in Class II average-angle patients. Spongious bone was thinner ( p = 0.016 ) and root apex was closer to the labial cortex in high-angle subgroups when compared to the Class II average-angle subgroup ( p = 0.004 ) . Conclusions : Mandibular anterior bony support and lower incisor position were different between average- and high-angle Class II patients. Clinicians should be aware that the range of lower incisor movement in high-angle Class II patients is limited compared to average- angle Class II patients . A 19-year-old woman presented to our dental clinic with anterior crossbite and mandibular prognathism. She had a concave profile , long face , and Angle Class III molar relationship. She showed disharmony in the crowding of the maxillomandibular dentition and midline deviation. The diagnosis and treatment plan were established by a three-dimensional ( 3D ) virtual setup and 3D surgical simulation , and a surgical wafer was produced using the stereolithography technique. No presurgical orthodontic treatment was performed. Using the surgery-first approach , Le Fort I maxillary osteotomy and mandibular bilateral intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy setback were carried out. Treatment was completed with postorthodontic treatment. Thus , symmetrical and balanced facial soft tissue and facial form as well as stabilized and well-balanced occlusion were achieved .\""
